In recent years, feminism films represented by super heroines have become more and more popular. This personal project studied the impact of feminism films on audience discussion, and compared the impact of traditional feminism films with super heroin films. Some interesting conclusions are included. 

This is my first personal work in Digital Humanities, and I believe it is a meaningful attempt.
