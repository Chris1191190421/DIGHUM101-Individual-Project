It is OK Films are all cliche nowadays and have too much special effects instead of story and acting and this one is not different The actress is not even average in my opinionI cant help but wonder if I watched the same film that impressed so many people As with most DC Comics films this one was a great disappointment While Marvel Comics films tend to be satirical and even selfeffacing DC films are pretentious and tedious Sadly Wonder Woman was no exception to this ruleThe scripting was totally unimaginative with dialogue that bordered on infantile Visually the landscapes all seemed plastic with Bmovie grade CGI throughout Even the music was awkward fighting the dialogue during the more intimate moments and drowning each scene in instrumentals I found myself doubting whether the director and editor are aware that there doesnt have to be a bombastic or flowery incidental score under everything — it displayed a lack of confidence in the dialogue and acting carrying the sceneRegarding the acting both Gadot and Pine gave it their best struggling with the stilted dialogue and boring telegraphed story line — but even they couldnt transcend this quagmire If not for its pretentiousness this film would have played far better as a comedy lampooning itself Instead it drowns itself in incessant platitudes of women goodmen bad framed within a plebian onedimensional plotAgain Im at a loss to explain its high marks other than to ascribe it to the currently trendy political correctness that elevates all patronizing misandry to high art and entertainmentIt was alright worth a watch but just mehI dont know what it is about DC films they always seem mediocre or just plain bad compared to Marvel filmsWonder woman herself as the character is good its just the story line cimagraphics action wich was badIt did feel like I was watching a cheap knock off of Captain AmericaOh and terrible just terrible German accentsJust to set something straight Wonder Woman is way better than either Batman v Superman or Suicide Squad It has what the others are missing which is a heart Also its a funny movie with Chris Pine acting at his best And no doubt Gal Gadot seems to be the perfect choice for Wonder Woman StillThis movie suffers from the same reason as the other two movies which is action and villainsIts too much CGI and a lot of times it is too obvious it just ruins many of the action sequences This goes for the final battle as well Its just worse the main villain does not represent a danger in any way It just floats in the air and thats allwtf It really is too bad because this could have been a very good movieInstead its a movie with great characters funa great soundtrack but broken by the action sequences and villains which are just so badIts really a shameWhile the action in this movie was admittedly fun not much else in this movie impressed me The writing was truly horrible cliché and very predictable The acting was unimpressive The plot was loose and poorly developed The villains were a question mark All characterisation seemed to be either absent or based on singular traits therefore arousing no emotions or empathy The romance seemed forced The ending was similar to Batman vs Superman There was too much CGI in the latter half of the movie and it was pretty obvious Perhaps the only other redeeming factor is that the music score was pretty greatWe were always going to watch Wonder Woman but figured wed catch it when it came out on BluRay After the commercials claiming certified fresh from Rotten Tomatoes i decided to take the wife to see if for her Birthday As soon as it ended the wife turned to me and asked as she always does what did you think I didnt even hesitate and responded IT SUCKED From the story line to the acting it didnt satisfy at any level Not for me not for the wife This movie is such a disappointmentI noticed a lot of positive reviews but I also noticed a lot of them are ranting on about how they got to go to a free screening before reviewing it and so many ranting on about gender equalityBut how is any of that a good thing that a movie is now based on these things did you get in for free and does it do good things for my gender I mean do we not care for the stories or film direction anymore or the overly bad use of CGI which is becoming existent in all DC movies now The film was a pretty bad rehash of the first captain American movie with a hint of thor and the new DCEU movie feel which is getting old quicklyBad cast bad music rolled into a story that could have worked had the setting not felt so recently familiar and had wonder woman actually come across like a strong badass character instead of scrawny weak looking hero she was never all that interesting in the comics in all fairness when she started out and only stood out later on for the fact she was barbaric and wasnt against taking the life of a villain if she felt it was the right thing to do even making the justice league turn their backs on her at one point for snapping the neck of maxwell lord but this movie was clearly just made to keep feminists happy and it seems to have done the trick but like with the ghostbusters franchise if you are an actual fan of the franchise before the new movie then you will be sorely disappointedIn short in this movie she is less of a conan the barbarian or red sonja in this movie and more like xena warrior princess honestly you want a real wonder woman movie just go rewatch red sonja and call it a day DC havent saved anything in my eyes yet I feel they should have gone with supergirl or something and gotten her angsty character traits down perfectly with her rage and a great movie could come from itI dont how do people rate movies this is clearly one of the worst movie I sawI mean seriously without going into spoilers and explaining this reason and that reason like everyone else has already done i will just say this movie was bad Not super horrible but not great either I cant believe this movie gets rated this high on here I mean this movie is rated higher than just about every single marvel movie All 3 captain America films iron man guardians of the galaxy Its even rated higher than other dc movies like batman 1989 bataman returns and supermanJust a total nonsense rating it getsIt looks like a quarter of the reviews here are 1 star another quarter 26 stars and the last half are 710 stars Many in the first and last partitions seem to be rating it because they think that the film deserves a higher or lower rating than what it received despite them not actually thinking the movie is a 12 or a 710 star movie If were assuming a 1 star is just almost the worst movie and a 10 star movie is almost perfect nobody can honestly watch this movie and call it a 1 or a 10 star movieTruthfully its an incredibly mediocre movie with poor acting from several cast members obviously poor CGI in many parts and a godawful story that struggles to hold the attention of a preteen that cannot justify a 710 star review However some of the actors are too good some CGI too impressive and the action too interesting for it to be 1 starDont trust the reviews of the people that rate it that way because they want to skew the rating in a certain direction From someone that loves action and superhero movies its a 410 on a good day I wouldnt want to watch movies with those that rate it outside of the 26 star rangeThe usually wonderful Chris Pine was wasted and I fell asleepCGI was all that was good in this film Entertaining Close but not worth 2 hrs The dialogue was atrocious even though the acting was alright The script Crapping horrible If you have nothing better to do and you cant find it online for free then waste your hard earned cash and pay for the crap Its good enough if you need to pass the the time while your worthless life has nothing else to offerhow Wonder Woman 2017 is all bragging and zero substance just like Trump you know the feeling you get when you a watch a remake that was overhyped but its just an empty shell in fact well that is what we got Plot feels forced Young God coming into a new world trying to save everyone and in the process disappoints in people Sounds Familiar That was fullon offensive trying to market this movie like something groundbraking in woman rights or first strong female character No guys Really Really Facepalm Poor story poor characters boring and uninventive Nothing more to sayAttention girls women and Hillary supporters you finally get your chance to enjoy the most popular movie genre as we step into summer We already know the usual mens enjoyment concept from the comic book movie where Batman fights Superman or Captain America fights Iron Man or Harley Quinn flaunts a sparkling tight thong Now a female superhero stars in her own femaledirected movie in armor built to expose her arms legs face and shouldersDoes Wonder Woman automatically pass as certified fresh Is it considered sexist to criticize a movie by a female director No and noThe first few moments progress with the velocity of a tuckeredout tortoise It begins with our hero Diana remembering her childhood when she felt inspired to fight for her fellow female warriors on their Zeuscreated island This repetitious slow prologue only establishes facts that later get repeatedThings still start off rather slow in the first act but women may love the immediate role reversal to give them well overdue credit Right away Diana rescues a man from drowning following a fight between the united Amazon women and a technologically advanced German army These battles look less like the usual fan service kind of writein and more a choreographed ballet of steel mesh fit for the most committed of DC followers The male viewers will offer praise as well such as key scenes which tribute all the classics of guysnightin cinema and a direct connection to Wayne EnterprisesThe DC Universe could finally find its footing yet improvement advances just by a hair compared to the loathed predecessors of the cinematic universe The more forgetful characters here contribute nothing important both in writing and direction making the world around them equally shallow in cinematic exploration The most accurate Greek mythology fact stated here is the womens birth origins from clay Oh and the island somehow coexists with the rest of the world only accessible by a portal It seems DCs cinematic universe cannot decide on its own realityHowever both the theme and artistry picks up from here As the pilotspy takes her from her home into civilization he teaches her about his way of living as she arrives in London The detail of her unfamiliarity parallels any immigrant arriving in a new home As Diana takes on the city fine dresses interfere with her ability to fight She refuses to accept societys standards of being a lady nor does she tolerate their form of government From her experience good generals fight amongst their other soldiers rather than sit in offices She cleaves against her sword and shield and sees the contradicting wide lacy indigo dresses as a straightjacket to her destiny So we can conclude one applicable takeaway women empowerment means showing lots of skin Does that also give women the right to sexualize their wardrobe along with practicing brute strength Celebrating sexual freedom should never be a sign of fighting for othersOutside of the IsraeliAztec heroine the characters either hit or miss your memory as they come Her spyboyfriend works alongside a trio of soldiers who each voice strong opinions about bringing a woman on the battlefield with them The first a Moroccan adds needed male flavor with his zesty interaction with the female hero The other contributes sympathy as he generates a needed soul on the piano The third named Chief gives a great backstory to America for Dianas understanding Outside of the heroes a great female villain addressed as Dr Poison compels your curiosity of her backstory thanks to her hazy performance behind a secretive phantom mask So what went wrong here Their accents resemble two days worth of dialect classes rather than someone who breathes the culture If these American films continue to misrepresent other cultures why bother attempting to please an international audience After all no one can buy into a Greek island of Amazon woman descended from Israel Britain and AfricaBy the time the third act rolls into play the drama declines as you come to realize how little puts Diana in a real mode of conflict The surround sound sure enough shakes your seat but the male villain she confronts belongs in Marvels long index of forgetful final bossesShould this define 21st century feminism Should we celebrate making women feel empowered by blaming their problems on men Wonder Woman focuses on painting women as the only true saints in the world whilst all the men cause the worlds problems Ever heard of Aileen Wuornos Whose biopic starring Charlize Theron was also directed by Patty Jenkins Was she not responsible for all sorts of problems Men are not the sole blame for chaos pride is which everyone who has ever lived and ever will live falls short ofSuperheroes but while they need to act better for the viewer to enjoyEverything in wonder woman is decent except story direction and philosophy I dont know why they focus the war crap what the heck with plain war why cant they give the better meaning didnt wonder woman got lot things to express Support character is like what villain is bullshit even the boss is just pop and suddenly diehalf of the movie is nonsense not importantno meaning and non memorial and after you finish it you will forget almost of the movieDC make a bad move here I guess they didnt learn a single things what magic that happen in dark knight and man of steel They focus too much with Justice League to compete with Marvel Epicness is not here just a bitter tasteDC you shouldnt stay in the past success your glory days is the proof of downfall get over itwhy cant you go for the future you really have tons of nice story only that alone can easily beat marvelI have to say all DC hero needs NolanSeriously hes the only one that know how make the real DC hero movie4 is my best with a generously as DC fan otherwise I will give just 2DC I know you can be lots better than thisif you not ask Nolan do it pleaseCant say I was ever a fan of Wonder Woman but then again Im not a fan of DCU in general with the exception of Batman hated the atrocious embodiment by Ben Affleck though Given that I thoroughly hated the new Superman movies as well as the awful Superman vs Batman  whatever that was I still decided to give WW a shot  and I was pleasantly surprised for the most part Wonder Woman puts all other recent DC movies to shame through a nice character introduction and the buildup though predictable well its a comics inspired movie after all its well supported by Pine and Gadot and once their little band comes together Taghmaoui also gets a piece of spotlight Several in factI was half expecting to dread the WWI background but instead I found it refreshing Marvels Captain American went on for WWII a decision saved by keeping the war in the background Here it serves as a vehicle for the discovery of humanity as shallow as it may be Theres plenty to like in the movie the fighting scenes are decently choreographed the soundtrack is great the characters are expectedly onedimensionalOn the downside  the editing keeps the movie from being a blast At one point the group who met WW couple of days ago and barely exchanged words somehow find it to give her a boost the same way she was trained as a child I bet somewhere theres a scene that wouldve explained that moment  the nonsense about love and humanity that Gadot is made to spew at the very end basically wrecks the entire character buildup  David Thewlis is completely miscast His appearance in armour is ridiculous seriously professor Lupin as a full fledged action hero at one point hes without helmet and the mustache complements the armour like a dog flea complements a cup of Earl Grey  the movie takes itself much to seriously and I do take into account that the few bits of humour revolve around a formerly isolated person who gets updated on to the current state of things It does pull a few laughs but not nearly enoughBeautiful cinematography aweful plot script and directionWhile this movie isnt bad it has the downfall of coming out after every other superhero movie in recent years Its all been done before Nothing new here The acting is good and Gal Gadot is fantastic Its just a boring story thats so overdone recently with the countless other superhero movies You end up not really caring about anyone or anything going on and hoping it would end sooner than later Id give it 25 starsI had no problems with the script the screenplay and what notThe problem is with the actress Gal Gadot All she did was project like a model Was she doing a fashion shoot or a catwalk Totally different from the real Wonder Woman persona She looked so skinny and weak for the DCbased Amazonian GoddessI know that she is an eyecandy but guys this is an action film come onA better choice would have been Gina Carano the MMA fighter who played Angel Dust in Deadpool Or a younger version of Lucy Lawless who played Xena in the 1990s Or anyone from the UFCMMA womens league They would have looked better and badass at being Wonder WomanThats itOhmygod how can anyone watch this 141minute chore and think its somehow breathed fresh air into the lead balloons that are DC Comics movies On a more positive note because there were so many trailers featuring Taron Egerton Ansel Elgort and Dane DeHaan I finally realized they are actually three different dudes who get asked to be in moviesOrigin stories usually suck At least this time we dont have to watch Uncle Ben get murdered again We start on a hidden island that is hidden so well that you cant find it unless you fly into it or sail to it Men are absent until Chris Pine shows up who claims to be above average through some very very below average dialogue This Wonder Woman movie is different because its set in WWI and we get to fight the Germans Red Skull and Captain America had to wait through the 1930s before taking their turn Logan was splitting skulls way back in the Civil War I believe Are we going to get an Aquaman movie set during one of the Opium Wars I hope I hopeEvil we know is nothing by itself It has to coopt people and make them do bad things And if evil can get another piece of evil to join it say like Star Lords dad or Darth Vader tried to do theres no telling how bad bad can get Good thing theres good people in the world heroes and gods to keep us from killing ourselves too muchThe plot meanders and heavily paws at noble ideals of love peace and human failure Humans dont deserve Amazonian protection nor do they deserve movies like Wonder Woman Ares wants war forever and Hollywood wants us to eat these garbage bites forever Why are all the DC movies so dark so stormy so seriousOh we get some lighthearted clothes shopping in postVictorian London Its awful funny watching an Amazon shop for dresses Women dont need men for pleasure but anyone with a vibrator could tell you thatIts good to see Chris Pine Chris Pratt and Chris Evans the Chris Syndicate getting so much work these daysThe first and last 15 minutes of the movie are worth watching its the tedious middle part that completely ruins everything but even the good parts are not without issuesDone to death one liners delivered with an annoying accent by an annoyingly naive character  all of this wrapped in a flat performance  but Instead of a cold hard reality check reality is distorted to entertain the delusions of this woman whose entire scope of knowledge about humanity comes from 3 thousand year old Greek fairy talesThe script is even more mediocre than usual the issues presented are entirely unrelatable thus failing to engage the viewer  or at least this viewer  on any level Whenever I am presented with something that is supposed to get an emotional response out of me it eventually feels like a botched effort for various reasons One instance fails to be impactful so I feel like Im watching a seminar where some statistics are mentioned another is stating the obvious so plainly I feel like Im watching a recap of the movie instead of the movie itself Theres one distinctly Greek thing this movie doesnt have but should have adopted before anything else the makes of a good dramaI have a particular and very subjective criticism about one thing When German people talk among themselves they speak English with a blatantly fake German accent This is not Assassins Creed where half of the movie ended up being Spanish in this movie it would have been perfectly fine to hear authentic German language and read subtitles for those 10 minutesAnd last but not least The last time CG physics made me chuckle like this was when I watched Tyrannosaurus Azteca a 29 rated movie on a 25 mil budget Now that movie is so bad its good This movie is just badI usually dont write reviews but seeing the hype going around this movie and finding nothing in the movie to make me feel it is worth all the praise I decided to give my 2 cents on this movie Superhero movies nowadays are the thing to be in Everybody loves them and they earn well That said I think they are becoming increasingly predictive and mindnumbing boring I know mine is not the popular opinion out there but this movie enters my long list of over hyped superhero moviesWonder Woman starts of with us being introduced to the world of Amazons and their home Themyscira I have to say I was pretty thrilled till the first half hour But that is when the movie starts to go down The story moves at a snails pace with some humor in the form of Steve Trevor Chris Pine and his secretary Dianas introduction to the human world makes up for some funny moments which after a point seem forced Although I do give credit to Patty Jenkins for capturing the naivety of Diana perfectly The second act sees Diana and Steve going to the front which seems to take forever In between they pick up three mercenaries who apart from providing some comedic relief dont do much The third act gives us some much awaited action sequences which I must say have been very well done Although the final showdown just like the previous DC movies comes as a letdown considering the preceding action sequences Also the ending king of ruined the effect of the movie for me you have to see it to knowIn all Wonder Woman delivers on a lot of fronts Action sequences have been well choreographed acting was decent except some cringeworthy moments from Gal Gadot and the comedic tone was also there But the long running time makes the movie boring and thinking back I can surely say that some scenes shouldnt have been there The movie does provide some powerful moments towards the end but by then you are wondering if this was worth all that came before Also the ending aaaarghhhhh I guess too many superhero movies have done what Wonder Woman tried to do thus nothing really stands out Except obviously the fact that this is the first female superhero feature filmOverall plot is interesting but the scenes are silly and sometimes contradict earlier scenes Dialogue is trite  Worst 74 IMDB rated movie I have ever seen Must be many fake 10s Boring and 50 minutes too longThis was disappointing The rating is too high The story was trying hard to create villains and hide a surprise and a reveal and instead managed to drag things out and become boring The acting was bad Actress was hiding behind the effects and should do B moviesSomehow i thought this was a good film It was almost a Captain America remake with a gender switch The main actress cannot act She cannot even open her mouth and say a word with effectSorryThat would be my explanation how anyone gave Gal Gadot a role Weird So bad with her words and wordingThis movie was terrible I can say it was boring too Patty Jenkins is silly and an amateur This movie has all CI for everyone to hide behind Gal Gadot gave a drama school performance and Steve Trevor was bad perhaps reacting to a silly script After this movie I can say DCEU is finishedThis is so cheesy there is cheese stuck to my ceiling and is gradually melting and falling on my headHer acting is as wooden as a block of cheap quasicheese bought at WalMart but why is the story so boring I mean it was so predictable and as usual they tried to gloss it with CGIHonestly it is better than total rubbish like Thunder Force because the actress is smooth and has lickable thighs 3 stars just for that but otherwise five it upAfter watching this and Melissa Mccarthys stupid movie this year i feel the creativity and desire to make something good or even half good has disappeared and they are just dishing out garbageLook honestly is the agent and studio head and VP etc did Gal Gadot then good for them It started on the couch and ended up at their pad I am jealous but you have now fulfilled your promise to her and it is time to let her go She is so boring and cannot even say the words I would gladly watch her in R movies but stop dishing out punishments to audiencesWhy choose the first world war
This is your typical super hero film there is not a lot of great cinematography and typical interchangeable music score Theres no indepth characters too The action scenes were limited because it is the world war Definitely a boring watchThe best thing about this movie is it shows which critics are in the pockets of the movie studio or that are so totally out of touch with reality that their opinion is irrelevant to the mainstream movie watcherI was being kind with the 310 I paused it twice to go and do something more interesting like cleaning the oven Far from it There are so many better choices Her acting is stiff Just badBoring DC movie
Really boring movie One of worst from DC in recent times 310That 3 stars is because she puts out fastOK I was super hyper about this movie just like the rest of us Supero hero fans and after seeing the great reviews I definitely had to see it Unfortunately after seeing WW Im beginning to think any reviewer who gave anything over a 610 had to be paid This movie was boring and way too longeven for an origin story Like hurry up and get to the point already The acting was bad Not sure what accent some of those guysgals were supposed to have Overall I walked out of the movie disappointed and confused as to how the ratings were so highNothing worth seeing their attempts at humour got maybe a half smirk  at best  Romance felt forced and there was no chemistry  Very bland origins story as is expected of this genre  Dont understand how you can rate this above a five out of ten  Truly bored during the entire thingNormally i would have given a 5 or 6 but taking in consideration the high rate i am giving a 3 Boring action Movie not funny not dramatic not a Wonder Movie Due to high rating my expectations were very high and it ended in an average Movie Two hours wasted I Think imdb administrators should Review their policies or rules as the rating in IMDb is becoming untrustable I see many awesome Movies rated as 7 or below and then things like this Movie rated more then 8 I like some Bollywood Movies but is very hard to find a good one based on score all of them are above 8 Please IMDb be awesome as you were Before This movie sucked  I did not enjoy it  the CGI was horrendous  Thank god i didnt pay to watch it The plot was weak  the whole thing about love was cheesy  The acting was OK but nothing wow  I just did not enjoy watching this movie at all Im hoping that this fad for here movies will soon go away Im getting really tired of watching this rubbishBoring droll predictable unexciting typical of all weak comic book movies lots of action but little drama plot or compelling draw to the characters BlahAbout my reviews I do not offer a synopsis of the film  you can get that anywhere and that does not constitute a meaningful review  but rather my thoughts and feelings on the film that hopefully will be informative to you in deciding whether to invest 90180 minutes of your life on itMy scale 15 decreasing degrees of terrible with 5 being mediocre 6 OK Generally held my interest OR had reasonable cast andor cinematography might watch it again 7  Good My default rating for a movie I liked enough to watch again but didnt rise to the upper echelons 8 Very Good Would watch again and recommend to others 9 Outstanding Would watch over and over top 10 of my ratings 10  A Classic Less than 2 receive this ratingHey Hollywood I am older than 6Could you make one film without oneliners and comic relief Just one
ThanksI hate to say this but I am sitting in the movie as I wrote this and hoping beyond hope that the second half gets exciting Chris Pine is outstanding as he usually is when he is the support Gal Gadot is an extraordinary actress but her accent is slightly irritating but made up for by the fact that she is perhaps the most beautiful woman I have ever seen on screen But back to the movie it is just slightly boring Just another run of the mill super hero recipe that gets more boring after each passing I am angry with myself for not watching it from the download I made of it from the Pirate Bay but I was craving coke and popcorn I am sorry but I refuse to be a party to these movie studios continuing to just roll stuff out because they have a captive audience I will watch justice league from a mobile device for free and close that my anger is probably still high after watching that jack afflict defeat superman Shame on these movie makersi think the acting was bad Even Gal Gadot was bad and she looked bad to my opinion too Everything was a cliché The directing was without any zest or depth Even the effects were 90s quality except for a very few matrixlike style fighting scenes A big piece of crap i have no idea why many people liked it Stop this word  i want out idiotsTo quote a popular Internet Age meme WHAT THE F DID I JUST WATCH More pertinently WHY IS THIS FILM BEING i SHILLED FOR AND ii WHY DOES IT GARNER AVERAGE SCORES IN THE HIGH 7s HERE AT IMDb AND 90 AT RTI never before thought much of the whole feminazi or SJW conspiratorial take on how social engineering is said to be taking place―through the agency of entertainment its content and subsequent promotion However Wonder Woman has caused this reviewer to stop and take pause For this film is one woeful pile of garbage even in the context of a comic book schlock that should be given a Razzie for its crimes against the filmic medium not garner ridiculously unwarranted praiseFrom its horrid casting and barely passable acting was Gal Gadot away sick during the acting module of her JIDF training tenure to its amateurish stunt work and ensuing overuse of CGI effects―necessitated in an attempt to futilely smear over the the films said substandard chopsocky  pewpew sequences―Wonder Woman is one of the worst if not THE worst comic book film I have ever had the displeasure of running afoul ofFrom go to wow the film is an aural and visual turd de faeces There is so little to redeem a film like this that one must wonder what was going through the minds of those who crafted it Did they watch the dailies Did the actors have any input in the creative process whatsoever Was it all green screened Surely this was all filmed blind blind drunk that isEven for those pushing the film as an empowering vehicle for female actors ― they have very little to grasp at here The male costar Chris Pine is given the bulk of the films derdumb dialogue thus insultingly relegating the titular character to playing second fiddle So much so in fact that for most part Gadots role arguably fails the very Bechdel test the film and those who champion it strove to emancipate the yoke of Of course this must all be tempered with what the director and screenwriters had at their disposal with respect to acting clout which was patently very very little assuming the drivel was not all spouted ad libitum ― a suggestion not as fanciful as it might normally seemIn short The dialogue was stilted The interactions wooden Obligatory love sceNE singular hamfistedly shoehorned and cringeworthy to bear Little character development to speak of Barely a thread of connection was established between viewer and the characters they were meant to invest in The acting was sub par at best A literal failure on every objective filmic measure Even rustedon Wonder Woman fans would struggle to find tenable arguments for the existence of this film in the egregious form that it has been renderedI normally do not write reviews for films of this shabby stockin any capacity However given the hubbub surrounding Wonder Woman and its association with the womens movement I felt compelled to throw my 2¢ worth into this well of bubbling fetid waste For I feel we must speak out against blatant shilling for that which patently does not deserve it on merit and we must fight against the inclination to grade on a curve that has gripped our societies since the advent of the InternetMoreover the process factory structure that the industry applies to the production of films in this genre all but guarantees one schlock after another These films are clearly produced only to make money As such ― given money inherently corrupts all that it comes into contact with ― the end results are fait accompli This is not a propitious philosophical model nor a mindset anyone should advocate forThis race to the bottom which we are embarked upon does a disservice not only to the art form but also to wider culture and societyWonder Woman is not the femalehelmed comic book film you were looking for Move onBefore I start I want to be clear on something I gave the movie 3 stars but its not that bad the movie deserves between a 45 and a 55 The reason why I gave this movie a 3 is because of the UNBELIEVABLE hype it got and the only reason for that is because its a superhero movie directed by a woman and it stars a woman I dont hate women and I am not antiwomen at all because nowadays if you say those things you will be labelled women hater for no reason So to balance it off I am giving it 3 stars because seeing its getting 8s9s that it never deservesThe first thing I absolutely hated about this movie and its the SAME thing with BatmanVSuperman  Suicide Squad literally EVERYTHING you saw in the trailer were the best and most important parts in the movie You dont even have to go to the movie because you can watch those trailersThe story and the movie itself were so boring there was nothing happening at all you dont feel anything for the characters and character development was nowhere to be found  the movie was dark except for the themyscira part  and dont get me wrong I have nothing against darkheavy movies The Dark Knight is one of my favorite movies  but the cinematography in the movie falls short I dont want to even start about the forced jokes and the oneliners that were made especially for the cinema audienceSo what was good about the movie I thought the pacing and the story structure were actually better than BatmanVSuperman  Suicide Squad You had a beginning  a middle part and a end part that made sense and were not all over the place The fighting sequence and the special effects were also good enough not mind blowing but it was nice The acting was not bad The only one I really didnt like was Gal Gadot She does not have something special except that she is nice looking  but to be honest she was not bad or something Ive seen worseThe story itself was OK everything made sense and like I said it suited the pacing wellOverall the movie was slighty better than BvS and Suicide Squad because of the pacing and the movie structure the bad guy in this movie was as bad as those other movies and it had the same problems as the other 2 moviesWhat I really dont understand this amazes me fumes me blowes my mind is how is it possible that the ones responsible for DCU and are calling the shots are still giving Zack Snyder  Co a chance BatmanVSuperman was so bad it damaged the image of those 2 beloved characters Suicide Squad was ridiculous bad and now Wonder Woman falls in the same category I made up my mind even if I love DC so much I will not be going to Justice League  even if it gets a 1010 what it certainly will not seeing Zack snyder is responsible for this it will be a big turd as wellWonder Woman as a film is quite bad Dont believe the fanboys or feminists who are trying to con you in to thinking otherwise I think they wanted it to be good so badly that they may be even fooling themselves While its not as bad as BvS or Suicide Squad its still dreadful in its executionspoilerfree The bad Almost every line uttered is a cliché with bad humor injected at all the wrong timesThe movie is full of loudmusic blindingcolors Zack Snyderesque slowmo and it follows Snyders lead delivering truly cringeworthy dialogueThe villain is shallow as can be They try and set it up as some sort of huge twist in terms of who the villain is but you can see it coming and when its revealed it packs no punch at allThe plot is as dumb as the other DCEU efforts to date Most if not all plot devices are shortcuts and are so badly introduced into the story that it honestly takes you out of the movie if you value story over whiz bang effectsSpeaking of effects the CGI is shockingly bad especially the battle scenes Its very unnatural like the wirefu or Charlies Angels days of defying physics and gravity Blurry background and shaky cam are the worstThe overall story telling is as stereotypical as it gets I know its a period piece but the big bad the awkward love story and the hyperfeminist overtones all jumble in to one big messThe attempted balance of humor and darkness fails It had to be a result of orders from higher ups that wanted to try and inject some Marvel movie type sensibilities Be a leader not a followerGal Gadot was as bad as expected SO wooden she simply cant actThe movie could have cut 30 minutes and no one would have knownThe good Chris Pine Great acting and overall performanceThe first act with life with the Amazons was interesting delivering a nice set upForced humor or not a few jokes did land Not a great batting average but it was somethingGal Gadot may not be able to act but she is sexy as can be and does deliver believable actionOverall I didnt like the movie and I doubt anyone but the rabid fanboygirls will think very highly of this wasted effort of a movieThis film was a chore for me to watch and finish The only reason I managed to sit through it is due to my compulsion to finish what I have started That is just me With that said I do not find Gal Gadot pretty and am not interested in the timeperiod because World War I seems so technologically drab to meYes the odds were stacked against my liking this filmIm a huge fan of Superhero comic books and so far Ive only been disappointed by the handsome Chris Evans Captain America AND the resent Spiderman homecoming with Tom Holland And now this Gal Gadot is Super beautiful but thats it I saw her first in Batman vs Superman and I was horrified by Ben Afflecks Batman and then I was thankfully introduced to Henry Cavills Superman had dodged Man of Steel because Christopher Reeve was Superman for me and there I felt his Superman really radiating from the silver screen and then there was WonderWomans first appearance there OK for that movie but for her own movie Wonder Woman I expected something more than pretty Super looks and grunting I havent seen Gadot in any other movie but as Wonder Woman goes it was meehAnd the story line was as great as The Emoji movie 3 stars because of the wonderful Robin Wright and Connie Nielsen They know how to deliver Super powersPlot well there is a woman and is wonder but she is more like a God that can do whatever she wants There are a lot of contradictions nonsense and exaggerations and a lot of things are just cinematic The story is pretty poor nothing serious or complicated or unpredictable
The thing that really bothers me a ton is that is very and too much sexist in my humble opinionActress  Actors the two of them are quite good especially he but the othersSoundtrack is a thing that is really enjoyableConclusions if you are searching for a movie with just a beautiful actress that interprets a character that can do everything youre welcome But if you are searching for something serious well youll have to turn aroundThe movie has a great beginning great actionfight scenes kinda abuse of CGI but of course you would expect this from a hero movieFor be a hero movie it brings something a bit different than other ones not sure what exactly is but it is pIt will be a solid 8 if they did not screw up with the lame plot twist but probably comics is same s so not sure im not a true fan soAnd for last the jokes were pretty bad typical PG13 American humorGal gadot acting and voice were something2 hours and 30 minutes You could have did it in a half hour cartoon Lousy script awful villains what a sad waste of time and money Sure could have used a real amazing movie to lift our spirits to end 2020The actress in leading role  Gal Gadot  can not actShe can Not even change her accent
thats why they asked all the other actresses Amazon Warriors to imitate her accentAfter watching several movies from her its obvious that she can only repeat herself on the screenNothing against her But she is just a Pretty Face and we can consider her as a Model at its best but acting is not one her talentsThey made a Wonder Woman movie without any wonderI admittedly dont think much of thriller super hero movies based in World Wars because the technology is not as cool and it trivializes these important murderous events but Wonder Woman was especially badThe actress needs to go to acting schoolAll I saw was Gal Gadot trying to act as Wonder Woman and not doing a very good jobAll those ratings have got to be fake I can and will not believe that most people ACTUALLY thought this movie was good It took literally until one hour and 14 minutes half way through the whole film to FINALLY get some action sequences that are longer than 5 seconds Everything beforehand is boring preparation garbage and stupid dialogues by uninteresting cliché characters nobody cares about mixed with some dadjokes even immature teenagers would heartily yawn atThe end was also really really cheesy completely ex machina and bad seriously who wrote this crapCompared to other action hero flicks this falls super flat on all fronts Uninspired story and antagonists far too little action too much blabbering and cringey PEGI13 fillers and jokes210 this movie is utter trash so dont waste your timeGal Gadot this is from your sister in the fight against the disgusting and lecherous male gaze Men should not look at womyn usAlso you did the nasty with the first man you met No one can blame you I did the same but now you know its filthy come back to the light vagineNo more movies in this franchise until it is renamed Wonder WomYnScreenplay and cinematography are mediocre at best What hit me hardest was the borderline bad acting from Gal Gadot Sorry that was super awkward at times and totally unexpected for meCant recommend the movieI was very excited to see this given all the hype and positive reviews Not to mention my girlfriend wanted to see it and theres not many she actually wants to seeI doubt you can imagine the level of disappointment I felt by the time it was over And I honestly have no idea why so many people think its so amazingWWI was a huge tragedy but the first war that was very well documented And I would have thought that if they had picked that for a setting that there could have been some semblance of realism somewhere Not to mention some way of involving her in events that actually or at least might have happened So maybe thats nitpicking But from start to finish the plot in general had holes big enough to drive a warship throughI cant really comment on the acting as the script was so bad I dont think anyone could have saved itIt would have also helped if it would have had a great or even good antagonist But the villains here got so little screen time they never felt even a little threateningA good supporting cast could have made it better as well But they too seemed to get no character development and didnt seem to have too much of a reason to even be there aside from the odd bit of comic relief and to remind us of how gorgeous Wonder Woman isTechnically there was nothing special about it The CGI was nothing special and the editing left me wondering how much had been cut outOn the plus side and maybe the only positive about the whole movie was that Gal Gadot looked great as Wonder Woman But really the only reason I can think of for all the glowing reviews is that people love watching a hot woman kicking ass and taking names and she didnt actually take that many namesbut she did kick a lot of ass thoughAnd in case youre curious my girlfriend liked it a whole lot less than meWorst part Right during the beginning they have an Armidillo That is an animal exclusive to North America Explain that writers As usual on any female action movie the action is slow and blotchy Only old Kung Fu movies can make women look bad ass Long Kiss Goodnight is an exception So this movie uses exposition time to the point of boredom Did we need over 10 minutes on the bath scene that did nothing for the story OH then she slams against a cliff that also does nothing 36 minutes in 15 hours left I give up Thank gods I didnt waste money on this crapHonestly not one of the positive reviews Ive read knows a damn thing about the comics Lets just hope Deadpool 2 doesnt sell out to this wussy guilt trip sappy vomit that is todays mediathe same old story told again and again I think the whole movie is very predictable and you know exactly whats going to happen This lame story has been used over and over several times in other movies they just added effects and voila you got a cash cow If you are in to this fantasy maybe you will find it entertaining but its forgettableDISLIKES1 This movie is far too long and inflated with unnecessary lines Diana is too preachy her selfrighteous monologues and dialogues contribute nothing to the film to the contrary they rob the viewer of the suspense and enjoyment of the film 2 This is a fantasyaction movie but there is not much action and the mixing of fantasy with an element of warped history does not help either Of course the producers were aware of what they were doing They deliberately depicted the Turks as the partners of the Nazi Germans who developed chemical weapons during WWI Sorry I am not a 5 year old and I know for sure that Nazi Germany had not existed until 1930s and the Turks had stayed neutral during WWII Actually to the contrary of what the movie shows the Turks saved a lot of Jews from the hands of the Nazis If the producers were looking for a Nazi collaborator I wonder why they didnt chose a different nation who indeed helped the Nazis during the war eg Switzerland Sweden Italy or JapanI wonder if John Kerry used his influence over the Hollywood producers when he met them last February Of course one should know why the US has created so many superhero Hollywood characters Such superhero characters have merely served towards the USs goals during the 40s 50s and the cold war era against the Soviets Capitalism V Communism By the looks of it such superheroes will serve the USs foreign policies for a long long time to come 3 The message of the film is rather laughable considering the number of people Diana already killed her shouting about love at Ares was particularly silly at this point First kill and then send love messages Yeah sure We have seen this scenario in real life indeed No the world does not need a superhero thank you Bush Obama Trump Kelly LIKES1 This is not a low budget film by any standards Costumes special effects etc were all good 2 It is good to see a strong female superhero amongst the male dominated superhero characters 3 Fighting scenes were good but I would have expected to see more of themOh boy I was so excited to go watch this movie like no other This movie had a lot of problems I thought that it was really boring and her origin story did not make really much sense to me I think this is another dc failure people are really really over hyping this movie This movie is really about dc trying to copy marvel in a way so fans like it but they didnt fool me this movie copied captain America the first avenger in a lot if waysSTAR RATING  Saturday Night  Friday Night  Friday Morning  Sunday Night  Monday Morning Diana Gal Gadot was raised on a distant planet of only women where her mother wanted to protect her from the physical demands of fighting like all the other women there But one day she starts to rebel and unleashes some hidden powers she was unaware of meaning the rite of passage has come so her mother tells her the story of a spiteful son of a God and his attempt to destroy the Earth Then Air Force pilot Steve Trevor Chris Pine crash lands into their home confusing the order of things He reveals he has a book that contains plans by evil German commandant Ludendorff Danny Huston to unleash a deadly nerve gas on England And so Diana and Steve must head to London to thwart his diabolical planThe superhero franchise on both sides of the DCMarvel divide must really be doing the rounds as now we have Wonder Woman who was a character in the recent disastrous Batman Vs Superman movie in her own more than feature length film And after this there is of course the Justice League film where all the main players are having a big jamboree together Whether this was the inspiration behind this films existence or pressure from the feminist movement to get some good ol equality up there on the big screen is unclear but either way the debut feature length directorial effort of Patty Jenkins is a long joyless effort that wastes a golden chance to level the playing field for female superheroesLike Batman even more so in fact Wonder Woman has been taken from a pretty camp light hearted source and been transformed into something far moodier and deep on the big screen where undemanding fun has been substituted for wondrous spectacle But for all the awe inspiring effects and breath taking action sequences it cant make up for a total sense of humour failure in the script as well as any careworthy characters or snappy dialogue as well as a totally sloppy incoherent plot that really fails to suck you in for the length it does She may be beautiful and glamorous to look at but Gadot isnt the greatest actress to say the least and co star Pine is equally vapid and bland Even a support cast including David Thewlis Ewen Bremner and Lucy Davis cant help Performances wise the best thing is Huston as the villain who really fits the skin of his character but cant make the whole thing taste any betterIt would have been great to see a good Wonder Woman but sadly this is just Blunder Woman I wasted about 45 minutes before I had to leave That says a lot for me because I am a cheapskate and had paid for a double feature I couldnt bear to wait through this one for the otherIt was a pretty film but as with many others in the current generation fell way short in content Kind of a beauty is only skin deep kind of thing My daddy always told me that it was the heart and soul that counts and this movie has none of that It was full of tired clichés presented in a way that made me feel somehow like the director was a cheesy 1950s misogynist trying to make a buck off of girls and women for which he had no real respectIt is a wonder women allowed themselves to be represented this way but hey maybe it redeemed itself in the second half I just could not waste the time to find outThis movie was deeply disappointing Most of the movie was spent focusing on the man rather than Wonder Woman Too much slow motion and a slow story made this a real yawnerRatings are too high for this movie the movie is poorly written The film was slow to develop and does not deliver with the premise The character development was boring and the acting by Gal Gadot is stale which carried over into the movie Its a cliché movie and while not completely a failure I believe it is one of the most overrated movies Ive seenSuch sophomoric and simplistic junk Weak and boring script Manichean conflicts Glorification of good wars this one fortunately won by a supermodel superhero with only the highest principles But it is adults who praise this film Superhero movies used to be for kids Now they are for infantilized adults who still possess the simplistic moral outlook of children Its no wonder the country is in the state its in given that this is the intellectual level of our cultureFor the first female superhero movie in a while I was pretty excited I didnt go with massive expectations I just wanted an action movie with a relatively good story and bearable characters All I got was a cliché love story centered around awkward teenagerlike interactions between a headstrong woman and a not so headstrong man who is trying to keep said headstrong woman in check but failing you know typical chick flick nonsense Oh and throw in a COUPLE of cringey girl power fight scenes that include Wonder Woman constantly throwing sexy shade at the camera YawnIm neither a fan of MARVEL or DC Overall this movie is a disaster If theres anyone has ever really WATCHED it heshe will know how awful it is Yes the actress is fantastically beautiful but thats it thats the only good thing about this movie The story line is terrible like in hell Since Im not allowed to post a spoiler I cant write any specific plot but trust me do not watch it or your day will be ruined plus The only reason I rate this 210 rather than 110 or 010 if I could is because of the beauty of Gal GadotThis was really a waste i dont know how this movie can get such a high rating This is beyond my imagination  but sometimes i wonder if its possible to cheat the IMDb system Or a lot of people getting paid to give good ratings I am floored this movie received such favorable reviews I thought it was really really bad The CGI was embarrasingly bad and the story just wasnt engaging at all
Gal Gadot is a beautiful and talented actress but this movie was extremely disappointing and not entertaining at allLazy writing and lame plot This is another Snyder masterpice with a dumb plot and over the top action WW is a woman who is supposed to stand for strength and her own will but the whole plot is driven by the man by her side The fact that every single person she is up against seem to be a moron does not to much to maker her more credible as an actionhero The scene where she is rushing soldiers in a bikini is laughable The stormtrooper aim that only hit her shield and nothing at her unprotected body is bizarre and enough to just turn you off the whole film The DCEU killed is own potential with Batman vs Superman and Suicide Sqad this is just another useless attempt at making film and it should have gone from script to bin not stopping at celluloid before thatI think the only reason this got good reviews was because it was compared to the previous disastrous film output from DC Wonder Woman is possibly the most naive character in comic book cinema often to the point of being wilfully dense And the villain reveal at the end is just awfulThe movie followed the used to death comic book movie formula The characters felt generic and the villain was the typical single use variety The story was obvious and little happened that you didnt expect If youre looking for a movie to watch while you wait for another good superhero movie then this movie is still barely worth your timeIll be brief and to the point As can be exited  the production special effects and crew is impressive But the content is pretty shallow A messedup Greek theology that presents Gal Gadot as a goddess And subsequently most of her acting is computer aided CGI Bottom line shallow content plus too much CGI equals disappointmentWonder Woman 2017 is a generic yet slightly entertaining adventure movie with no deeper understanding or appreciation for the source materialGal Godot lacks the presence and physicality of the DC Comics character David Thewlis who is a brilliant character actor simply doesnt fit as the god of war either Better see him in Fargo 3 where he really shinesWonder Woman is the usual superhero cash grab fest based on a completely predictable paint by numbers script The script here is so interchangeable it could fit any Hollywood heroes from Indiana Jones to Robert Downey Jrs impersonation of Sherlock Holmes On the bright side there are a few laughs here including the unintentional ones when they cut back and forth between the stunt woman and Gal GadotWonder Woman this is surely not but a brainless 141 min adventure ride If you expected any other than another DC Comics sellout at this time the last laugh is on youShe is a beatifull girl but unfortunely she can not actBloated poorly written bad comedic scenes and a plot that makes zero sense The characters are significantly dumbed down from the first movie the relationship issues displayed ultimately mean nothing There is zero character development
Feels like a cross between the Nonsense plot of the Last Jedi and Ghostbusters 2016
I recommend using this movie to torture detainees in GITMOGal Gadot performance is laughable very cliché dialogue ruins the movie The plot the story is just terrible and the whole thing is just unrealistic for a superhero movie Gal Gadot overdoes it and is trying too hard a great shame really way overhyped and a total let down DC extended universe really do struggle at making films trailer is very misleading the film is discombobulated and doesnt flow well at all Even suicide squad was better than this joke Movie way too long for what it is which leads to all this unnecessary dragging out of the movie couldve been done at least half hour quicker all the audience was thinking was when does this end and how do I get this 140 minutes of my life backThe No Mans Land scene was cringeworthy Gal Gadot looked like she was doing a commercial or an ad lol This movie is overratedPlease dont waste your time on this movie
Life is too shortI am really losing hope in everything that I used to believe in in general thee days This load of crap is rated 85 What the hellThe movie is so weak Its like the movie makers dont even care about anything anymore other than completely depend on CGI and good effects Like they KNOW we are that dumb and will just take it up The story was god awful stupid even by superhero comic standards and the acting was atrociousThere was literally ZERO character development for any of them No depth It just all was whipped along as if for the sake of completing the movie None of the characters were likable and relatable on a psychological level Comic relief was forced and did not make us laugh Watching Diana do her innocent act was totally unbelievable and as fake as it can getI fell asleep My girlfriend well asleep and my friend who is generally very tolerating of dumb movies EVEN he fell asleepBut thats okay not a lot of movies are necessarily good But what breaks my heart and trust in the movie world is that this is getting so much attention and respect with a stellar rating Its an insult to some of the other gems people have produced to see films like these get ratings similar to theirsDreadful I expected this to be at least fun but in fact it is unbearable Just not my cup of teaI still have no idea why this movie has 7 ratingJust so boring that i slept in the cinema hallTotal ripoff of the 2011 Captain America movie copy off other ppls homework much This is what happens when your trying catch up in a race your not even inIts just plain old boring 2 hours of talking 9 minutes of action with bad cgi Predictable dialogue predictable story cringeworthy jokes about penises How this got an 84 rating I do not know Best SuperHero movie of the year Doubtful Logan is a much better movie than thisSave your time and watch Risky Business featuring Tom Cruise insteadI understand that the plot could be interesting to some people but boy could they at least get a better actressMeh what else do you expect these days from DC They make a new mediocre movie and people act like its the best ever they are notI mean even if someone liked this god awful movie you still cant proclaim its The best superhero movie and its better than The entire MCU movie collection Dont make your reviews so obviously fake especially when youre posting from an account that you just openedAs for the movie  just skip it Gal Gadots charm in the interviews and talk shows does not translate to the big screen Any woman with a pretty face can recite lines Her performance was generic at best The entire plot was shallow paintbynumbers and the jokes were cringeworthyI really wanted DCEU to succeed to have another cinematic world in submerge in They may make some money and have their army of loyal fans rabidly defending them but in the end the quality of these movies is really really low Even Thor 2 had a more coherent story and more entertaining dialoguesThis was a very bad movie DC has another stinker on its hands Most people are going to see it because the trailer was fantastic The movie however is not Its just absolutely absurd The SJW feminist nonsense is just over the top Gal Gadot is a terrible actress The battle scenes are just garbage as well as its treatment of the conflict and resolution Its over the top absurd How most of the professional reviewers havent called it out is unreal If youre a history major interested in history youre going to hate this movie and its message Its just dumb Wonder Woman basically has the same mentality as Emily Blunts character in Sicario and its just as absurdIts not a good movie I cant recommend itThere is nothing new here just you average cheesey super hero flick Thats made twice as bad by using the setting of world war one Too see wonder women with minmal clothes on crossing nomans land is comical it could be seen as satire Alot of reviewers are Confusing this with nazi Germany but thats 20 years later This is an abosulte joke of a movie what else is there to say about it When youve got wonder women running round with a sword and sheild cutting down German soilders for no plot related reason Walking into fire and deflecting bullets with her magic wristbandsAny one episode of the 70s tv Wonder Woman surpasses this pile of junk And hey how about you know Throwing in an actual enemy from the comics like Toyman I nearly fell asleep in the theaterThe music smartly composed and gets u in the sceneThe landscapes eye opening and must see allPicture quality near perfectsowhat makes this movie awful lets go a little technicalwhen filming an action genre the choreography is designed such a way that all impacts hit the center of the screen when you draw two diagonals from opposite corners the center is the junction in the middle this way both the action seem satisfying becomes easy to catch by the audience more funin this movie the opponents are mostly on the left side of the screen the impact misses the center and heroine is mostly far edge right on the screen why is this filmed this way  who knows butall heroes and fighters in action genre kick exposing their front side their chest and their front faces the audience giving an epic movementpose in this movie all kicks expose the back side of the heroine so we see no epic pose but cute underwear basically wonder woman is a film about cool chicks wearing minies and kicking while the camera at their back side this is a cheap trick to sell action audience and no one is pleasedgaş gadot is one of the hottest woman on the genre but she is yet not ready to handle leading rolechris pine saves all scenesDavid thewlis adds elegancebut these two dudes no matter how hard they try couldnt save the moviethosere why the effort and the music and the landscape and two brilliant actors gone vainI went to the theater with very low expectations after seeing the trailers despite the extremely positive reviews and scores both here and at Rotten Tomatoes I am deeply amazed anyone could give this garbage more than 2 stars out of 10 The acting is terrible jokes are awkward CG is the worst Ive seen in years Even 20 years old movies are better on that front Almost every scene is with extreme DOF and all characters look like cut out and placed in fake and badly rendered environments The lighting is totally off The dialog is so horrible Ive read opinions this movie is much better that Suicide Squad To me SS is in a different league It is entertaining and the love story between Harley Queen and Joker is enough to make the whole movie Wonder Woman is even worse than Batman vs Superman which is one of the most boring movies Ive ever watchedAfter 2h21 min of a awful movie I have to tell you DONT GO American super production full of mistakes No moment good to share Dont go  Bad actors bad special effects bad movie compare to expectations If I was not able to drink during the projection I would have left after 10 min I hated this movie and I had to share it so you dont spoil your timeI really dont understand how this film got high reviews I watched this and gradually slipped into a stupor it certainly has no redeeming features dull plot going through the motions acting and bland special effects  give it a missThis is my first review in this website and by now you know why Im here i couldnt not review this movie it was very bad extremely boring Not enough action too much talking the ending is the worst utterly predictableToo many things to write about bad acting they tried to add some humor to the movie but no one laughedI think they knew that the movie will suck thats why the high reviews are thereWorst movie Ive been dragged to The want my money back kind of movie Nothing original Predictable Nothing new or surprising Prefabricated patterns put together as a hay stack Terrible acting mostly I agree that it is a difficult fantasy story but well its not even funnyAnyone who saw the original Wonder Woman movie as bad as it waswlll find the original far superior to this piece of crap even though the newer version is full of cinematic gimmicks which the original did not haveLind Carter was not the greatest actress but compared to Gal Godot Carter was by far the best Wonder Woman Besides Carter is beautiful Gadot is very unattractive I suspect that those who exalt this film are feministsAnd compared to the original movie this one is badly directed It lacks cohesiveness and credibility It is as others have noted a badly flawed flick If you go to watch it dont have high expectations because you will really be disappointed The flick got a lot of undeserved praiseThe only reason I went to see this flick was to take my 14 yr old granddaughter and my 17 yr old grandson My granddaughter loved the movie my grandson was bored by it thought it was a waste of time But I can understand why anyone who is still a juvenile at heart might enjoy this fantasy Also why viewers who were not old enough to watch the original Wonder Woman had nothing to compare the latest flick with the original It is like the James Bond movies The original Sean Connery versions were by far the best but as the movies went on and new actors became James Bond they couldnt match Sean Connery Likewise Gadot is no Lynda Carter And I dont mean to compare the James Bond movies with the DC movies because the DC movies including the latest Wonder Woman are not even close to being in the same class as the James Bond movies It is like comparing the Untouchables with the BrahmansAnother thing that one has to wonder Wonder Woman was not released until June 2 yet there were so many reviews written prior to that date So is someone stacking the deck in order to get people to watch the flickMy god such a huge mess like other female lead movies like resident evilElectracat womanNothing but a feminism propaganda Just random madefortrailer tiny scenes that add to nothing have zero depth and dont make up a coherent plot Walltowall inappropriate songs that come at random times Boring plot if you can even call it that boring and indistinguishable flat charactersTheres no depth and no story If youve seen the trailers you basically saw all the oneliners and money shotsTalk about corny jokes this movie is full of them The story is so predictable and the characters are not good at allNot sure why everyone in the media were praising this movie Its way overhyped and overrated The first 30 was BORINGEven the main actress was terrible Seems like everyone in the media is hyping this women Gal Gadot is a wannabee Angelina Jolie but uglier cannot act sucks at action scenes etc etcAll she does is try to look pretty But she cannot pull it off This movie was just terrible from start to finish Especially the storyI tried not to doze off during the movie but couldnt help it I eventually left the movie halfway through and decided to wait for the next Spidermen showingAgain this movie is garbage The only reason why everyone in the media is rating the movie and the actress so high is because of where she is from
