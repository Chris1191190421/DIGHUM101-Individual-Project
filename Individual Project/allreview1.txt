Hubby and I are Canadian seniors who just saw this movie and we both loved it I was fighting back tears at the end and experienced a range of emotions throughout RBGs indomitable spirit hers and Martys commitment to each other and when she truly and passionately finds her voice  we found it truly inspirational RBG is obviously a remarkable legal mind and the USA is lucky to have someone of her quality on their Supreme CourtOne thing though I dont understand the reviews that slam the movie as being political all we saw was a lawyer sincerely trying to ensure everyone received the same treatment under the lawLong may she serveI just cant put this movie in words but I can proudly say its one of the best films Ive ever watched I may have some biased opinions since RBG is one of my role models that I have been looking up towards making this movie so much more powerful and motivational to watch I enjoyed every second of this film and I would definitely want to recommend this to others as wellThe people that are saying the movie was boring probably arent interested in court cases as that was a big part of the movie After all RGB is an attorney The movie is about how she was one of the first that fought for gender equality  won
The entire theater was applauding
If you are a fan than you definitely should go see it but bring some tissue  the very end of the movie will give you the feelsThis movie was very well done Good acting and a good story Please ignore the obviously biased trolls This is a very good movieBeautiful film about the career and life of Ruth Bader Ginsburg symbol of our time A strong woman that never gave up The cast is brilliant Felicity Jones perfect as Ruth Bader Ginsburg Armie Hammer as wonderful as Felicity like his loving husband They have an unbelievable chemistry together in the film and I can´t imagine another performers for the roles The rest of the cast have great performances too Kathy Bates Sam Waterston Justin Theroux Cailee Spaeny This is a necessary film in our days and Ruth´s story inspire us You have to see itThis movie was awesome It was inspiring and all children should see it they would come away feeling better about the future Eager to make choices in the interest of sharing their talents with the world Feeling nothing can stop themThe same people praising a Walk The Line or other dramageographic movies about mens have decided that RGB only deserves the documentary treatment but no her own larger than life movie about her critical fight for woman rights and equality Forget about those haters this movie like Walk the Line is a great mix of emotion humor and reminder of how social justice is something still that need us to fight for it Go enjoy this great optimistic movie perfect for the start of a new yearLove it It was warm  passionate and heart filledHer nonintuitive grasp of words The way her intelligence does not fully integrate and is an annoyance is a gradual forming of a parallel map with the purposes of its thoroughness cleansing inefficiencies This is a use of intelligence as subversion Then its not feminist per se but a witnessing of subversion itself The exceptional all come to know their destructiveness Most interesting is its home life where dysfunction highlights how different they are to you and I see the mother and daughter where not only her ethics well yes its an A paper is the same familial crime as rock n roll but the nuance of her ethics being linear not lateral creates a dispute Naturally then the daughters rebellion would be an intellectual one Ruth is a bully and she needs everyone to know how smart she is I wonder is it a worse pain to grow in this setting or surrounded by no intelligence at all She taught your mom to question everything In a movie making her unquestionable But her grating tediousness is still a bit of theater in all the ways her intelligence is outrageous The husband as the second seems odd especially as her unconventional manner combats the power of such chiseled Aryan athletes she demands the same rewards Then the films hopeless journey is the same as Rocky but language performance not boxing Lost causes are the ones worth fighting for The climax of language shows in their face the moment where they turn This is how she captures the old boys club requiring eloquence to match the narcissism of their power Take note as her coaches keep training her eloquence  being right always Let Ruth be Ruth but on their terms the scripts emotional journey is the power when meeting them half way It is also not just the effect of the machine of her intelligence but how it cant be disputed reaching something stirring For this presented as a voice of god the final text proceed to give her one reward after another for being stirring almost to the point of shame how it so embraces the theater performance warranting accolades not the simple act of being right Its championing subversion as the healthy mechanism of society as all art does Then this was a subversion of a power structure while embodying its utmost making the walk to Lincoln showing a living sainta danger repeating the mistake of the old boys club to begin with mistaking power for merit As in Ruth would grow herself to be the power and new Ruths must come in it keeps making it about her But being lionized has always been misunderstood as some sort of an endpoint and for art its a convenient shorthandRuth was a real life superhero overcoming unequal treatment at every turn in her career Yes there are other women who made just as much impact and no one is stopping anyone from making movies about them too They really should Ruth is a timely subject because we are witnessing the culmination of her career today She made an impact that spans across political parties and ideologies She worked for equality and how is that a DemocratRepublican issue I am sure she had detractors on both sides An equal opportunity to be educated earn a living take care of your family etc should not be based on gender in a country like the USAI think this was a movie about someone overcoming huge challenges to better the world what more is a superhero than that It is a wellacted movie as well The support and love from her husband is a major part of her life and her daughter is the next stubborn formidable generation of women in the making Watch this movie and enjoy witnesses the work of a woman who did so much for us allTruly one of the best movies Ive had the pleasure of seeing RGB and Martins love story was so beautiful I was in tears by the time the REAL RGB came in to view It saddens me that it took me this long to see itLoved this movie about Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg and her rise to greatness If you havent seen this movie you should If you have children especially girls you should watch it with them They need to know who helped make so many things possible for so many people but especially for femalesHow refreshing it is to see that we have come such a long way The equality we enjoy now was only a veneer just 50 years ago The movie depicts the misogyny and patriarchy at the time with all its subtle undertones with exceptional talent and Felicity Jones was the perfect fit for the one and only Justice Ruth Bader GinsburgA well acted inspiring story introducing RBG as a student and young lawyer in her first of many cases which have changed the landscape of US law to increase gender equalityGreat movie It is hard to believe that in the year I was born women didnt have many of the rights that I take for granted now Felicity Jones is amazing as Justice Ginsberg After watching this movie I would like to know more about Justice Ginsburg and her beloved MartyLast yearI was inspired by Documentary RBG and now This movieThe climax was so awesome and well directedThe entire movie is taken perfectLoved thisAdding to my collectionRBG is an American hero and icon for a reason  because shes had a profound impact on the country for the good This film takes us back to when she was a young law professor who had t yet made her name Jones and Hammer are perfect as Ruth and Marty and the film is as careful to get the facts of their personal story right as it is to capture the legal battle they face An inspiring movie that fits the time in which it livesThis movie serves as a fine example of explaining why Change is not to be fearedThis movie So inspiring It honestly made me want to pursue law school to fight for more rights for victims of abuse Who knows I just might Thank you RuthGreat actors good pacing and interesting legal issues discussed in this drama Really enjoyable filmI didnt think this would appeal to me but I was hooked from the first scene Ruth is a modern day wonder woman with the same strength and presence I got teary at a few places This was really good So good that the 2 hours felt like 15 minutesIts surprisingly uplifting With the state of the world I thought this might end up depressing to watch but its the oppositeit reminds you that change is possible and will come whether men want it or not Dont let anyone stand in your way not a man not the worlds outdated ways and not even your own selfdoubtWho knew history could be this good or inspiring This is a mustwatch for everyoneAlmost missed this one after the mixed reviews but ended up glad I didnt Enjoyed every moment of the film lost and engrossed in thinking about what it mustve been like to be a shortinstature but towering in strength and determination Ginsburg during the years depicted here I thought the film did a terrific job of putting viewers in her shoes and definitely think it will be an inspiration for those of us who still value honest hard work ethical behavior kindness and joy for generations to comeWhen did you last go to a movie in which the audience applauded as the credits rolled It is not a typical Canadian response Behind me a young female law student was weeping As I sat there I was deeply and intellectually moved by the power of this womans life and the subsequent effect she has had on our lives on my life and I had been totally unaware of her Let me put that in context Although I am 20 years younger than RBG her litigational years were my culturally maturing years college university and entering the work force That was the culture of my years her years and I thought I knew the seminole personalities of my time but I had never heard of Ruth Bader Ginsburg Indeed until these past two years in which she has gained a rockstar like celebrity I had no idea of her influence on my life This movie and the excellent documentary RBG which on the recommendation of other movie goers last night I watched as background for this review have now convinced me that I would not have been allowed to be the person I have become had she not addressed the legal restrictions of gender in the law of the United States that undermined a global sense of personhood I am Canadian so these were not my laws she changed but the culture of the civil rights struggle in America was not lost on us My maturing personal ethic of the time cradled by my faith in a just God and a loving growing relationship with Jesus was not of feminism but of the rights of every person to live under a judicially just system and in a compassionate and culturally rich society I appreciate now that this was the justice for which RBG challenged her legal system Thank you Mimi Leader and Daniel Stiepleman for telling her story Now concerning the merits of the movie itself The cast is superb and the performances of Felicia Jones and Armie Hammer were deep and warm I was also impressed by how the role of young Jane Ginsburg adeptly performed by Cailee Spaeny gathered in the emotional climate of the time Wonderfull cameo performances The cinematography and soundtrack brought a sense of grandeur and the costumes a sense of style and subtle class I give this movie a 10 important out of 10 BioPicDo you think the constitution of America 🇺🇸 🤔 is a living document Can change be made Are some laws favoring discrimination mistakes 🤔 Watch thisI was raised in a home where feminism was derided Im now 52 and passionately feminist but needed this movie to really hammer home the reality of what Ruth and others fought for It also graphically depicted the social reality that women in my family willingly acceptedIm sickenedMore than that this film did what good film making should do through RBGs story I am inspired by her determination and bravery I felt loved and supported as I watched her husband Marty love and support herThe film reawakened me from an oppressive fog and I am now more aware of continued inequity and injustice It renewed my fighting spiritFor those who derided the movie as being a politically motivated story I challenge you on this Like other reviewers I see this as a story about RBGs incredible life and her personal battle and bravery is incredibly inspiringThe only criticism I can give to this movie really is that I would have liked more I would have loved if this was a mini series so we could see more of her life and accomplishments In other words a brilliant and important filmA documentary is a documentary and a movie inspired by real events is just that Each stand alone RBG is an outstanding documentary to which On the Basis of Sex should not be compared Yes the movie is old fashioned reminding one of the classic movies of the 40s So what The subject matter is still timely even more so in the climate we are now living inunfortunately there are probably many who want to go back to the great preGinsburg daysOn the Basis of Sex is another classic biopic movie It tells the story of Ruth Bader Ginsburg and the injustices at the time prevalent in law against genders I found the characters to be quite likeable and there was good tension in the story Weirdly there is hardly any soundtrack in the movie which does at times leave it feeling a bit dull But it has a great finish that makes it worth it Im not sure how accurate they were able to stay to the original story but its a good watch regardlessStory of a strong women in representation at a time where gender equality is still heavily compromised very inspirational and well executedThat was an excellent movie  documentary Said everythingI have no idea as to the accuracy of the film and I dont really care It represented one of the best members of the Supreme Court who championed gender equality when it didnt exist Growing up in the 1950s I witnessed first hand gender inequality with my mother who worked and was important to her employer and yet was paid less than men with the same jobs Felicity Jones captured the fiery emotions of Ruth Bader Ginsburg who started the struggle to gain equality for women Women were given the right to vote in 1920 but even today women are still paid less than men in most professions And so the fight that she started is still going on today and it was very enjoyable to see the origin of modern battle for womens equality as represented in this film Some male chauvinists might find this film unworthy but based on historic importance it is definitely a value movie to seeIts nice that a legend gets to see her life portrayed on screen while she is still
having a pulse I kept thinking of Thurgood Marshall also as an advocate for
racial equality and his portrayal by Chadwick Boseman in the film Marshall
Both On The Basis Of Sex and Marshall take a couple of people who would serve
on the Supreme Court and tell of cases in their years as advocates On The Basis
Of Sex does Ruth Bader Ginsburg justiceAs the movie shows it wasnt always easy After attending Harvard Law School
after undergraduating at Cornell Ruth Bader married Martin Ginsburg who was
a year ahead of her When Martin gets a job in New York City she goes to her
law school dean Erwin Griswold a pillar of the legal establishment played here
by Sam Waterston Progressive in many ways Griswold did in fact get the
first women admitted to Harvard Law But he did believe women ought to know their place at home and in the courtroom Jack McCoy Waterston is not
in this filmSimply because of her sex she could not get a slew of jobs that husband Martin
would have gotten easily She had her own dometic crisis as well when Martin
played by Armie Hammer came down with cancer She was thrust into the
role of breadwinner as well as homemaker And the bread at times was only
crumbsWith that kind of attitude and disdain shown her Ginzburg says this has to all
change and that women have to achieve real equality Oddly enough its the
case of a man played by Chris Mulkey who was denied an income tax deduction
for hiring a home attendant for his mother and was forced to stay home and
tend to her Mulkey is a bachelor and he did not want mom going to some
substandard nursing home On the basis of a man challenging gender roles
Ginzburg made her first markFelicity Jones of Great Britain played Ruth Bader Ginzburg a girl from Brooklyn
Not only Brooklyn but my part of Brooklyn as I read she attended James Madison High School which was two blocks from where I lived Nice Jewish
girls from Brooklyn make their mark whether its Barbra Streisand in music or
Ruth Bader Ginzburg in the law Theres such passion in her performance I
cant believe that Jones will be ignored in the Oscar sweepstakesAnother who should not be ignored is Cailee Spaeny the young actress who
plays daughter Jane Ginzburg At first glance she looks like your average
teen girl of the times But this young lady has read Gloria Steinem and
believes in direct action far more than Mom does Her scene with Mom with
those construction workers is a classic Hope Spaeny gets some recognition
in the Supporting Actress category she really nails it in her roleGood gray Sam Waterston as pillar of the legal establishment was one kind of
foe But there is the climax scene at the 10th Circuit Federal Court of Appeals
an actor Jack Raynor shows how deeply sinister opposition to change could be
One thing the New Right has always been good at is recognizing threats to its
perceived view of society Recently one of their religious right legal organizations lobbied against including LGBTQ people in antilynching bill in
Congress They reasoned that if you simply made it wrong to kill people on
the basis of their sexual orientation and gender identity they might actually
ask society to treat them with dignity and respect legally economically and
sociallyRaynor with that smug arrogance that the religious right has says that the
foundations of society as they see it will be torn asunder if Ginzburgs client
wins this case Felicity Jones who has been told to stick to facts and precedents and keep her passion in check gets up and just demolishes Raynor
With passion in check Jones impresses those Appellate Judges with the facts
but the restrained passion is there She sure impressed meHope theyll be some Oscar consideration for Jones for Hammer and for
Spaeny Most of all in that field of 10 for On The Basis Of SexCinematography was not the greatest but the great story covers the weaknesses of the executive branchJones does an excellent job of playing Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsberg and tells the fascinating story of her life focussing on the legal breakthroughs she madeI have a degree in engineering and in 2000 found issues in the workplace with men who didnt like to have women in his department One manager believed there was no point in hiring them as they all get pregnant and quit Never mind that he had two highly successful women who had kids at home working in his department Unfortunately I did exactly as he said but I had not set out to do so My overall department was changing while I was on maternity leave and would have been working for him when I returned That was not a battle I was willing to go through All the same there are now men who quit after their wives have children and we all deserve the right to that choice In the years I was there I made very valuable contributions and made systemic changes that were applied to all future products When I was ready to return to work I didnt return to engineering as there wasnt another opportunity in our area that appealed to me but I do own a company in a male dominated field and as the owner can work my schedule for a successful business and successful family Without women like RGB that would never have been possible So she wasnt the first female justice she was the first female justice that made sweeping changes to give men and women equal rights What good is a female justice if they are only going to uphold laws that keep women held backOne aspect of her life I wasnt familiar with was the close marriage she had For a husband and wife to support each other so was beautiful to see Despite your gender we are all stronger when our spouses support usThe only thing I think they could have done better was to list some of the most important laws she got changed or fights that she won in the end bio information I also would have liked it if they had included her being sworn in as a judge but I suppose that wasnt as big of a deal since she was the 2ndThe film captures a snapshot of the Justices early legal career Thank god it isnt one of those films that tries to jam in everything significant that happens in her life into one film To be frank I dont understand those criticizing the film as being way too heavy on the legalese In fact I would argue that the film does to great lengths to make the court case exciting to the average moviegoer It would be like if someone watched a sports film and complained that it focused too much on the gamesport Before watching the film I would of course google the sport to learn about the sports history and rulesThe film centers around a very important case that Ginsburg works on so of course its going to be packed with legal jargon and the monotony that comes with the legal system Courts and the legal system are almost never as thrilling as Elle Woods defense of Brooke TaylorWindham at the end of Legally Blonde and thats a good thing It is why for instance SCOTUS cases should never air on TV Perhaps Im biased as a political science student but I think the film does a good job of trying the explain the significance of the Ginsburgs arguments and how screwed up it is to have US law to include prescribed gender roles in a sufficiently artistic manner Its understandable if youre worried about not understanding the film but give it a chance and before doing so just read the wikipedia article on the court caseThat said I would dock one point for showing not showing enough of the difficulties of juggling being a mother and a law professorlawyer I only say that because the filmmaker chose to give her daughter a rather large role in the second half of the film so its important to flesh out her character and by connection humanize the person RBG I think its important for filmmakers to acknowledge the babysitters grandparents and etc the difficulties of raising a teeneager in the early 70s in the midst of secondwave feminism and etc These are the human interest stories that in partial made her extremely endearing not to discount her legal work to so many Its not that women cant have it all but its just easier for some women more than othersWell done and acted I think poor reviews are due to not liking docudramas and political topics I thought the movie was intriguing and a blast from the past to relive the 70s equal rights movementI am a female litigator and saw this movie with 3 lady lawyer friends today We loved it I didnt expect to be so affected by it but found myself moved to tears many times at the way Ruth stood up for us all and ultimately paved the way It was so inspiring to me I found it interesting from a legal perspective and historical perspective I already admired RBG before but didnt know a whole lot about her story I left the movie with a new real life superheroOn the basis of sex is a real life look at the uphill challenges that a gifted legal student and scholar faced during her early career One of nine women who were accepted at Harvard Law School in 1956 RBG had to explain to the Dean at a formal dinner party why she deserved to displace a man who could have gone to HLS in her stead There were other slings and arrows but the worst was that even though she graduated first in her class RBG was unable to find a job at a law firm The acting for the most part is first rate and the story shows that society is slow to change even now more than 60 years later in the metoo era The film is well paced and some of the photography is excellentAnti Jewish was fashionable in 1943 on to 1980s
Both Husband and wife were disqualified for work by quotas for Jewish people and outright discrimination
2 strikes and your out of a jobI am having some problems with other reviews This is not a documentary  it is a depiction of the case RBG presented to the court of appeals that presented the discrimination of the IRS law that prevented a man for getting a credit for caring for his mother It was the start of RGB gender discrimination focus for all to be treat equally A 2 hour film is not going to be able to present her life  watch the documentary which is so well done This is one case how it got to court while giving us the background of RBG life and how she got there A newly married woman her husband diagnosed with cancer and getting treatment while SHE goes to her AND his classes in law school Advances to her struggle to get a job with a law firm because she is a woman and she consequently teaches He supports her career all the way  this is the beginning of her fight for gender equality I feel this is a good film and a good way for younger people to learn of some of the struggle that people have defended for US
I admired the presentation of her marriage  she had a husband who supported her all the way  she was so fortunateBeautiful movie In a shirt span of 2 hours very skilfully brings out the struggle for equality of law Nicely acted Thoroughly enjoyedThe minute I exited the theater I was so compelled to sit down and write this review An amazing journey of a HARVARD woman that transcends time Ruth Bader Ginsburg is a profound and dynamic woman She encourages society to put themselves under a social and ethical micro scope and EXAMINE Felicity treated the material intelligently Mr Ginsburg Arnie Hammer was so supportive of the life journey of wife and family What a great performance by Armie I have never seen Armie as spectacular as him crying in the hospital bed with his wife A MUST SEE MOVIEA truly eye opening film about the progress towards gender equality Frustrating and uplifting Thoroughly enjoyed this filmAs a law student it was hard not to be inspired by the protagonist played by the always excellent Felicity Jones An important part of history brought to life on the big screen to great effect Was hooked from the word go Best film in a while post award seasonTruly enjoyable and inspirational film Both characters were way ahead of their times and fought the overriding expectations of the day Ruth was always a pioneer and Marty was evidently similarly inclined The main characters are portrayed beautifully by Felicity Jones and Armie Hammer A reminder of how things were for women and men back in the day and why we should fight with every shred of our being to never go back to such inequalityMy husband and both liked the movie and yes wed already seen RBG I recommend it to those who lived through the 70s and those who came afterIt was not perfectbut I had a really good time and it is an important matter to think about for every time our mothers just smiled In her time Ruth Bader Ginsburg was correctly seen as one of the most outspoken judges female or otherwise to ever sit on the highest court in the land the United States Supreme Court Twentyseven years of service on the bench from 1993 until her passing in the fall of 2020 and her fierce advocacy against White Male pushback made her known by friends and foes alike as The Notorious RBG The 2018 film ON THE BASIS OF SEX shows us whyFelicity Jones steps into the role of Justice Ginsburg having to fight the patriarchal society of the 1950s going through the prestigious Harvard Law School with some extra work at Columbia on the side Despite times that are quite trying for her Jones gets a ton of support from her husband Martin Armie Hammer and she rises in the ranks and into history first as a professor of law at Rutgers University The case that propels her into what counts for stardom in terms of American jurisprudence is a case involving a Colorado man named Charles Mortiz Chris Mulkey who is suing for not being able to get a tax break for being a caregiver to his ailing mother The reason the courts give is that giving care to any woman even a mans mother is not the accepted role for a Man in the world This is a case of a man being discriminated against due to societys moresin other words hes being discriminated on the basis of sex It is a case that after tons of pushback and pressure on her Hammer and her family she finally gets to the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals arguing that the law denying Mulkey the tax break violates the 14th Amendment which prohibits discrimination of any kind on the basis of a persons gender but is on the books because of the supposed natural order of thingsIt is only fitting that a film about one of the most prominent women in modern American history should be helmed by a woman herself But while Mimi Leders own film resume as a director includes 1997s THE PEACEMARKER 2000s PAY IT FORWARD and most prominently the 1998 science fictiondisaster film DEEP IMPACT much of her directing credits between 2000 and 2018 involved episodic television work including The West Wing she also did many episodes of ER in the 1990s All the same however such extensive television work does not seem to have affected the way she directs ON THE BASIS OF SEX with Jones a British actress giving depth intensity and dignity to her performance as The Notorious RBG Hammer is however no pushover either as her hugely supportive husband Indeed both Leder and screenwritercoproducer Daniel Stiepleman the latter being RBGs nephew refused to cave down to the urging of backers of the film to make the husbandwife relationship combativean extremely wise move on their part Sam Waterston is also quite good in a very patriarchal role as the Harvard Law School dean Erwin GriswoldRuth Bader Ginsburg was a fierce advocate for people in her life all the way up to and including the Supreme Court while surrounded by far more corporate Rightleaning fellow justices and her passing due to cancer left a big hole in the courts credibility Thanks to this film though we can really get a fair idea of how important her presence on the American scene was for us allA great movie depicting the reality of female treatment on more than one departments 910My wife and I both professionals about 15 years behind the real RBG found this movie both fascinating and painfulalmost as painful as the negative reviews that object to the Subject on the basis not of sex but of politics Too bad the knuckledraggers cant get past their own biases to enjoy this very good and intellectually engaging movie And yes we did find it suspenceful My wife too got directed to the typing pool after four years of college and three of grad school and I hope I was half as supportive as Marty We thoroughly enjoyed this reminder that even today the arc of history doesnt bend itself and that the only way to achieve your goals especially gasp equality is to keep pushing And we thought the acting was firstrate and loved the physical mismatch of the tiny Jones and towering HammerI gave this one a shot on a flight where they were providing free movies not something I would normally watch And with the current situation of division with liberals no way would I have watched this one Anywho I actually liked it quite a bit and was definitely rooting for her during her major scene The acting was all well done  well cast When one thinks about it now its hard to believe the bias towards man in the past Much more respect for Ms GinsburgYou may not know the woman and for some the term feminist has become an accusatory andor derogatory term But Ruth and other women like her fought for equality and things that now seem obvious and are established Things we dont even think about that were quite wrong And she helped changed a lot of it for the betterBut not everything she touched became something good so this is also her struggle And her fight and her persistence So the floor or table or whatever you want to call it is set Does it sound appealing to you then watch it This movie depicts future Supreme Court justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg as first a law student with her husband also entering the profession during the 50s Then it segues to the early 70s as she finally tries a case This was quite a compelling drama of her life and career during those times I just mentioned Especially when it explores some of their family life My mom enjoyed this as well So on that point we heartily recommend On the Basis of SexIgnore the poor reviews they are written by bitter misogynists Sit back and enjoy this fabulous filmBased on the life of Ruth Bader Ginsburg focusing on the early cases of her career as she tries to introduce the concept of equal rites for Women into areas of the US Legal System It focuses on the problems she faced at university the adversity her husband Martin beat the sexism of certain colleagues and peers and the barriers that the legal profession kept throwing at herThis is an intelligently written and incredibly interesting version of someone I knew very little about but someone who I now hold in the utmost esteem Both her and her husband are portrayed as moral driven intelligent equals in both their life and marriage and Felicity Jones and Armie Hammer do a great job Felicity Jones is starting to carve herself and solid career in Hollywood which hopefully will lead her onto more roles which showcase her acting ability and Armie Hammer is turning into one of my favourite actors his turns in Hotel Mumbai and Free Fire both are superbRuth Bader Ginsburg ends up as a US Supreme Court Associate Justice and it is easy to see why from how this film portrays her I am going to learn more about this pioneer nowWell worth a watch if you are interested in a true story which is intelligently written wellacted shows how important roles people can play in history if they are driven and care enough and you want to learn from them and about them If not watch It the Stephen King Remake  because that was pants and this is a 1620 filmI think this film was solid Not perfect But I certainly am not ashamed I paid to see itI saw the RGB documentary first And that really undermines this film because a viewer has an easy time seeing how this biopic doesnt perfectly address the actual source material This is a VERY common component for films based on reality And when there is a documentary which comes out first a lot of the changes are very exposed to the viewerFelicity Jones didnt seem to sound like Ruth Bader Ginsburg Her voice is a bit higher than Ruths real voice and Jones meter was a bit more quick and modern than the way RBG sounds in the recordings of her trials RBG sounds more like a kind old elementary teacher who really knows what she was talking about Jones sounded more like an annoyed young grad student in her deliveryThe film highlights one trial which Im almost positive wasnt RBGs first trial as a lawyer Or her first win to promote laws to end sex discrimination But the film presents it as if it is her firstThe film never shows the court deciding that she won her case It is shown in text which isnt enough if you ask me Also I didnt like that they seemed to prop up RBG by making her husband troublesome when dealing with questions in the trial They show the husband provide great answers to those situations earlier in the film when they were preparing for the trial This was a case where his character became inconsistent for the sake of overall narration Rather than because his actions happenedOverall I think the story was fine And most of my complaints are very small I dont have a gripe with them consolidating the story to her first victory for a trail on the basis of sex Thats the kind of thing biopics regularly do for the sake of the medium I dont mind where they started the story either I like the historical references they make to all the failed attempts to end gender discrimination laws over 100 yearsI generally liked the way they depicted RBGs husband and family Apart from perhaps feeling they should have shown her husband happy to survive and pass the checkpoints in surviving his cancerIf you havent seen RBG or The Basis of Sex I recommend seeing this one firstIts hard to do a well done biopic that covers so many important events in a persons long life but also goes in depth into sections of the persons life so you dont feel like youre just watching a montage This film succeeds at pulling you in to the important events while giving you an overall understanding of Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburgs life and accomplishments And she is a person so worthy of watching and being inspired by Good performances by allWell written directed and acted should be more like thisIve read many of the reviews Additionally I watch a lot of films A lot Just the ones in the theaters this movie makes over 700 films dating back to 2012 Many of the viewers I believe missed the point of this movie It is NOT a documentary about RBGs life It is a film about a specific case that made a profound impact on gender equality Sprinkle in a few life impactful life events along the way to the case and you have yourself a film This film was very well directed solidly acted and thoughtfully provocativeThe intricacies of the law arent simplified for the audience The script includes the nuance and the rhetoric that good law movies carry The trial scenes are without the thrill we are usually accustomed to usually in crime movies instead it has drama and weight in the social aspect that particular case had We are hooked into thinking about this issue of gender and then trying to think of a smart justification of the case with Ruths character Basically the director and the writer laid out the entire case in front of us then neatly arranged all the arguments into a tight brief as the one her secretary typed You will also like the mental aspect of this film where you thought youve lined up all your ducks only to get it shot down by very smart arguments Good script And very good acting by Felicity Very caring support from Armie And a beautiful surprise for the ending 👌🏽yet we still have so far to goLook at the beginnings of RPG her

Santa Ana Orange County CAA reverential tail which considers equality not just of men and women but of all people I loved the movie and I highly recommend itOn the Basis of Sex is formulaic and follows a familiar narrative but its still a great true story adaptation thats inspiring and well made Felicity Jones Armie Hammer and Justin Theroux all give great performances The soundtrack is really good and its well paced Mimi Leaders direction is also greatHighlighted the obstacles Ruth Bader Ginsburg had to overcome to kickstart her career of fighting for womens rights The movie was suspenseful throughout but a bit predictableRuth Bader Ginsburg the now Supreme Court Justice is an advocate for the advancement of womens rights and gender equality Her refusal to step down and her stubborn personality is one that has made her notorious amongst American politics making her one of the most influential figures within the nations justice system Here we are with a film that is cruelly overlooked A biographical legal drama that manages to both educate and dramatise an important stepping stone in the history of equal rights After all its her story that made history Ruth with the assistance of her devoted tax crunching husband independently takes on a case that unfairly limits her male subjects tax deduction to a woman widower or divorcée She identifies a glaring gap in inequality and decides to challenge the many laws of constitution to force a changeRuth is a powerfully inclined individual and director Leder ensures this is her story Her motivation into desiring a world that treats herself the same as her male counterparts is fully realised through a perfect use of a narrative time shift The biopic starts in her early years when she is denied the ability to finish her law degree in a different university and is unable to find a position within any law firm All of this because she is a woman The stereotyping and repression of opportunities for females within the mid 20thCentury is well unfair Stieplemans nuanced screenplay knows this and fully utilised Ruths lawful yet unfair treatment in order to motivate her when she takes on the main case Its frequently referred that protests are suitable for making temporary changes but if you want to change society then the law itself needs to be challenged A thoughtprovoking theme and one that holds considerable powerRuth found that if a man could be unfairly discriminated on the basis of sex then so could women She cleverly composed a plan in which a panel of male judges were more likely to identify with a male appellant Subtle yet ingenious psychological moves making Ruth a formidable lawyer However Leder doesnt just let her take all the credit Her close companionship with her cancerstricken husband and aspiring daughter meant that the case turned into a family endeavour symbolising the need for unity Everyone chipped in not just to win the case but to change history Absolutely compelling from start to finish even if the first act was not as persuasive as its concluding courtroom drama To balance its heavy subject matter with a light narrative tone is a difficult task but Leder does so effortlessly It allows this sense of approachability educating viewers who are not familiar with Ginsburgs prominent work whilst also providing humorous moments amidst societychanging battlesIt must be said that none of the above wouldve worked if it was not for Jones exceptional performance Nuanced controlled and quite simply underrated Hammers excellent supporting performance also elevated her talent More screen time for Reynor particularly during the Court of Appeals would have been nice to showcase his rising talent A few plot details especially Martins encounter with cancer were underdeveloped and did not provide much power to story However these are small criticisms to what is a tantalising biographical dramaI cannot understate how important this film is whether you are familiar with Ginsburgs work or not We have come leaps and bounds as a society over the past 100 years this film clearly tells us that And its inspirational leading individual shows that we shouldnt stop now We can make the changeI found this movie to be thoroughly engaging The story of RBG and her life was wonderfully portrayed by Felicity Jones Armie Hammer as her husband was a delightful bonus I was riveted to the story from the start and in tears at the end
I did not know much about RBG before this but now know what makes her the respected justice on SCOTUS
Her story of determination to become a lawyer and be a wife and mother at the same time in the 1950s is admirable Her fight to overturn gender bias was groundbreaking I recommend this movieI thought that the movie was entertaining and I often found myself immersed in the story Its a great reallife story that demonstrates the concept that we must fight for change rather than wait wot it to happen Go see this movieFrom the impressive script to the tone this is a movie worth seeingA lot of movies I see these days fall short of the message they are trying to get across but this one definitely did notRuth and her family done something incredible not just for America but the world While this wont win any awards its a history lesson in law which manages to make it exciting with some great performancesThe education and early career of US Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg the first woman to sit on the highest court in America is captured in this film It stars Felicity Jones as the young woman who attended Harvard Law School with her husband Armie Hammer and went on to become one of the preeminent legal minds of her eraThe film centers on how Ginsburg was initially instrumental and ultimately essential in an appellate case that helped pave the way for gender discrimination in federal law being eradicated Along with her husband she worked on the appeal with the ACLU heralded by Mel Wulf Justin Theroux a liberal with complicated principles Kathy Bates makes a nice turn as a famous hardened civil rights litigator who failed in some earlier cases Sam Waterston is a welcome presence as the outwardly progressive but inwardly parochial Erwin Griswold Dean of Harvard Law during Ginsburgs years as a studentJones shines in the role of the young Ginsburg a dedicated steadfast attorney who was undaunted by the entrenched views on gender in academia the workplace and ultimately in the courts She spends most of the film grappling with these challenges but all the while never letting go of her core principles and dedication to the lawAlthough this film occasionally lurches into Oscar bait territory it makes for a good portrayal of a woman who became a true pioneer in the history of gender equality and a good starting point to get to know Justice Ginsburg from where she started RecommendedMost bad critics about this movie which led me to postpone it too long are based on a confusion This is not a biopic about RBG This is a movie about her early years in law school and her first case Its meant to show the kind of woman she was and her struggle for equality Thats it If you want a bio go watch a documentary or even better go read a bookNow I dont know much about RGB Im not from the US so I cant speak to the historical accuracy of the movieBut from an entertainment point of view I quite liked it Felicity Jones delivers a good performance and Im not much of a fan of her as does the rest of the cast I didnt find anything terrible about the script eitherI would totally recommend it It may not be a complete biography but it draws attention to RGB and it will probably lead more than one to search for more about herFirstly as a disclaimer I went into this knowing nothing about the woman on whom this is based or circumstances upon which this was based so without being in possession of historically accurate context I can only speak to the the movie itselfI enjoyed it Instead of contemporary feminisms great vengeance and furious anger towards men approach this movie presented the plight of women as righting an unfair situation set in a time when the lawmakers thought it incredulous to consider inequality even existedA refreshing and very welcome change of pace in the current climate This movie didnt try to make me feel awful just for being born a particular genderInteresting and well made but like many true storys about the life of real people it lacks any real drama or excitement and tends to drag in places As an insight into the life and times of the quite remarkable Ruth Bader Ginsburg though it works very well and is worth viewing just for that Best watched on a lazy Sunday afternoon with tea and biscuits in my humble opinion 6510I decided to watch this movie for the first time after the recent passing of RBG She was an amazing lady and I did not know much about how she got startedI felt this movie may have been a glossier version of what it really must have been like for her but it did help me understand her background and journey better It is hard to believe she had such a perfect family and support system The movie makes me want to look up all the facts about her life family and careerThe overview of some of her judiciary accomplishments at the end of the movie was very helpful and there was another pleasant surprise at the end especially at a time when we are all grieving her lossI would not mind seeing a movie about RBGs life that started before her marriage and the birth of her first child I wanted more when this movie finished Thank you to all who made it possibleThere are few times in history that we must ever cleberate triumph over mediocre minds clouded by sexism racism ageism and sheer envy but that is what an intelligent women like RBG was forced to do to dare be lawyer teacher and judge and live the life of her dreams Shes an inspiring figure I dont agree with the speed of progress she made but I dont know much of the US social scene In Singapore we either dont talk of these issues enough or are fooled into believing that they dont exist I encourage teens and women across the globe to watch this movie about this very important figure in the US Supreme CourtI just watched the movie and like what Mimi Leder achieved here Felicity Jones is the heart and soul of the movie and her performance carried the film The supporting cast is spot onOn the whole Id say that On The Basis Of Sex is a good movie but not a great one In some places it can be a bit too obvious and blunt about its message and themes At other times it lags and can feel like a TV movie of the week or a sitcomtoo sugary and tongueincheekA solid watch nonetheless 7 out of 10I did thoroughly enjoy the movie however I think I may have been quite lost if I didnt a degree relating to government and politics Its not a blockbuster movie but one worth watching if youre wanting to better understand the legacy of RBGI understand they wanted to build the movie around the one case that was a defining moment in RBGs career but a full biopic would have been a lot better in my opinion I disagree with most critics the documentary was NOT better see my review for it great subject very poor execution But this movie is still lacking some substance and feels a little too much like its only scratching the surface Still well acted again disagreeing with most people I think the casting was fine and directed so I recommend itI really liked this movie overall There were plenty of good laughs and you really could quite literally feel like how Ruth Bader Ginsburg must have felt during that moment It really demonstrated some of the obstacles that she went through to be a lawyer as a woman in that era This movie is slightly less thorough than the documentary but still worth watching I do wish however that the ending had not been so abrupt Great otherwise thoughFelicity Jones stars as Ruth Bader Ginsburg in this movie about how she came to argue a case in tax law and upturn two hundred years of Federal law and American culture about sexual stereotypes Another reviewer says the movie is not political I disagree It is all political from the opening scenes at Harvard Law when the nine women in class are asked to justify their presence in place of nine similarly situated men through the end when she asks for justice Times she argues have changed and the law must change to reflect that That change in attitudes may seem revolutionary natural and proper in our society  although there are still those who would deny it  but the changes and arguments that led to those changes were purely politicalDirector Mimi Leder directs this as a personal odyssey and offers us characters living in the moment from Armie Hammer cooking for his family to Justin Theroux and the ACLU lawyer who fights Mrs Ginsburg over strategy and tactics Central of course is Miss Jones as Mrs Ginsburg She is excellent speaking in a muted Brooklyn accent that reminds me of my mother  and which Mrs Ginsburg did not use in her public appearances Its hard to make history gripping since we know how it came out The movie succeeds because it offers us the inner turmoil of the people involvedBoring and trite Felicity Jones was terrible in this movie I thought it would be better but it was just blahAlthough its based on a true story it seems to stick fairly close to the facts though the New York Times obituary implied she was more of a moderate on some issues than her latelife reputation that is based on her dissenting opinions in the more conservative Supreme CourtMuch is made in the film on how small Ruth Bader Ginsburg Felicity Jones is physically especially compared to her husband Armie Hammer The core of the film is her work on early sex discrimination cases in which the law differentiated between men and womenIf you like courtroom dramas and I do youll find this engaging even though there is little actionLegal drama about the female legal pioneer Ruth Bader Ginsburg The film charts her drive for womens legal rights in 1970s United StatesUnfortunately the movie is not delivered with much feeling for such an emotive subject The film is interesting enough but is quite academic lacking a swell of emotion somehow The climax is good although still lacked a real punchA movie about one of the largest human rights pioneers in history but somehow it falls short from being really good Perhaps this was too big a role for Felicity Jones or maybe its just the scriptI really liked this film It was entertaining in telling RBFs storyI like Felicity Jones a lot but it was distracting when she couldnt maintain an American accent sort of lost some authenticity luckily for the most part she did a good jobAll the other actors did a great jobI havent seen RBG so I cant compare it but i liked the film it was interesting to know all she went through All i knew was that she was a supreme court justice and that everyone thinks very high of herFelicity Joness acting was great although Im not sure her performance was quite as perfect as some of the other biopic portrayals recently I really liked Armie Hammer in this film The costume design is awesome aside from a crossbodybag supposedly worn in the 70s I was impressed to learn how much of the plot was accurate compared to realityHistorical documentaries always fall victim to the dramatization treatment of the cinema world As such we end up eating them up except for the purists as we become enthralled in the sparks notes version of the historical legacy these people left So in the age and time of politics lets pick a supreme court justice as the next one and see what stories are told Robbie K back on review duty

LIKES
Acting
Use of most characters
Makeup and Costumes
Good Writing
Jargon translated
Message towards key demographicSummary You can certainly get this from the trailers but the hallmark of these movies is often the acting and this film is no exception Felicity Jones talents continue to soar in her bravado mannerisms and wonderful delivery of a lawyer fighting for whats right Hammer as well finds his stride as the supporting character working to help Ruths goals The rest of the crew have wonderful acting ability and most of the characters are well integrated into the tale to really bring the most out of the case that would change so much And in regards to looks the makeup and costume department gets special props as they bring the times of the past into history and capture the looks of that era
Yet while the look is there does this film have the feel For the most part yes it does On the Basis of Sex has good writing behind it as a grand display of passionate speeches impressive vocabulary filled monologues and fiery passion filled scenes unfold Its smart witty and quite fitting of the prowess of the woman and probably something the older audience will enjoy Not familiar with the law and all the technical terms that come with it No problem This film has got the sparks notes version of relevant information there to keep you integrated into the case and not get too lost in all the convoluted terminology In addition the film makes use of the speeches to really try to inspire and fire up the young women watching It held the heart and soul of the movie and I think was the central aspect of the filmDISLIKES
Pace
Not utilizing other characters
A little convoluted
The Openings necessitySummary With these types of films the key is to work hard to make it entertaining and yet truthful On the Basis of Sexs pace was not for me becoming a little tedious at times as it hobbled along to get to the big case at hand This uneven pace brought rough patches that had me fighting sleep that took away the momentum of the movie What helped amplify this component was the convoluted moments where the law jargon took over the movie magic While Basis of Sex has interpreted much of the heavy technical terms there may be some very detailed moments that can bring a fog to your brain and potentially tire you out Fantastic attention to details but not the most engaging at times
In addition the other thing that also didnt woo me was some of the characters they didnt put as much focus on Kathy Bates the legend herself has little appearance in the movie despite being a selling point for the trailer The rivals led by Sam Watterson were semiused but only in the latter half instead of throughout the movie The result is taking away some of the heat and suspense I think they wanted to go for As for the opening moments of the movie well they are okay Yes they do justice in setting the stage and introducing all the pieces to the puzzle However these rather important moments feel a little fast forwarded to me rushed over and almost feeling unnecessary as much of the focus is on the big case instead of her entire life as the trailers portrayed Thus I think the direction was not all there in terms of how they wanted to bring her entire life into focus
The VERDICT
On the Basis of Sex accomplishes the goal of appealing to its key demographic showing off the amazing talents of Ruth Bader Ginsberg and waving the girl power flag high Its acting and character to use are fantastic for the most part with makeup and writing to really bring out the full prowess of the scene However the movie still needs some balance in terms of using all characters trying to tone down the legal jargon and figuring out what they wanted to highlight As picky as this sounds the movie was good and has artistic nature to it but it didnt quite deliver the ultimate performance they were going for Worth a trip to theater Not so much but still worth checking out when it comes to home viewingMy scores are
BiographyDrama 75
Movie Overall 70This is a biopic of US Supreme Court Judge Ruth Bader Ginsburg Felicity Jones It starts with her as one of the few female students in Harvard Law School Martin Armie Hammer is her supportive husband and a second year student They have a baby named Jane Dean Erwin Griswold Sam Waterston claims to be supportive of female inclusion but is often dismissive with his comments Dorothy Kenyon Kathy Bates is a veteran crusader lawyer and Mel Wulf Justin Theroux leads the ACLU lawyersI only have one major issue with this movie It feels like the writer had worked over the material a few too many times Its too traditional Its aggressively standard Somebody had massaged the story a few too many times I foresaw the problem when the movie starts with Inspired by RBG does show up at the end of the movie which helps to soften the blow It jolts the movie back from the Hollywood script The movie could have started with a meetcute with Martin I dont mean to create another fake news situation so maybe do the real bad date charade scenario with the other guy Starting with RBG in a blue dress in a sea of stuffy suits is hitting the nail squarely on the head This is more compelling as a love story I dont know if the filmmaker feared diminishing her if Martin has more time I think its actually their marriage and their diverging careers that are the most intriguing part of her journey Their relationship is everything The rest like the insufferable little misogynist comments are now standard cinema and rather pedestrian As for Felicity I initially thought that she is too much of a movie star Im sure RBG was a pretty young thing once I doubt she was movie star material and we mostly know her as a little old woman with the pulled back ponytail That may be why Felicity seems closer to the mark later in the movie Armie is well matched He is one tall of water The couple has solid chemistry and it would have been intriguing to center the movie on their love It would make this a more personal biopicLets leave politics out of this review My wife understood exactly what RBG went thru She is also a lawyer and says women have to be
much better than men in the legal worldLots of gender discrimination still exists The equal pay bill still has not passed RBG despite stellar class standing could not find a spot in a lawfirm She had to go into academia The first part of the movie was a bit slow in my opinion RBG young is not easy to believe The second half involving the big case was interesting No remarkable acting in thisNot as good as RBG but a great film about an important woman in our countryMy ReviewThere are many Human Rights heroes male and female who have staged David and Goliath or in Ruth Vader Ginsburgs case Bader and Goliath battles and this amazing and intelligent woman has earned her place of honour in not only the repeal of archaic laws in the USA affecting Womens rights but as this story shows also a single mans right to be a carer for his aged and ill motherI wish some of the personal domestic family life padding in the earlier part of the script had of been minimised as it seemed to slow the pace down a little till we reached the real battle in the court room and after reading Ruth Vader Ginsburgs contributions to The Marriage Equality Supreme Court hearings in 2015 and especially after she appears briefly as herself now in her mid 80s I think if her achievements in that debate had of been included it would have made this a much more dynamic and dramatic storySome of her submissions in the Marriage Equality Supreme Court hearings of 2015 are worth repeating here to demonstrate what a great woman she isRuth Bader Ginsburg eviscerates samesex marriage opponents in courtexcerpts from The Guardian 28th April 2015At 82 the supreme court justice cut through the question of gay marriages constitutionality in a way that seemed to move even her most conservative peersMarriage today is not what it was under the common law tradition under the civil law tradition said Ginsburg when Justices Roberts and Kennedy began to fret about whether the court had a right to challenge centuries of tradition
Marriage was a relationship of a dominant male to a subordinate female she explained That ended as a result of this courts decision in 1982 when Louisianas Head and Master Rule was struck down  Would that be a choice that state should still be allowed to have To cling to marriage the way it once wasBursch was similarly eviscerated by Ginsburg when he tried to argue that the sole purpose of marriage was to ensure a stable relationship to enable procreation
Suppose a couple 70yearold couple comes in and they want to get married remarked the 82yearold Ginsburg to laughter after a protracted debate over whether it was fair to ask couples if they wanted children before allowing them to wedYou dont have to ask them any questions You know they are not going to have any childrenThis movie has nothing to do with the recent World Wide repeal of discriminatory laws regarding Same Sex Marriage Equality but I couldnt help relate to the not so far off history the case in this movie took place in 1975 and when you think of the painfully slow progress of Racial Womens  and GLBTQI fights and debates for Human Rights still being waged and discussed in Australia and I recognised all the chauvinism and Right Wing Evangelical male Characters in our own Federal Parliament today arguing quotas for equal Female representation and other countries today it amazes me that the process has taken so long and makes me grateful for women like Ruth Bader Ginsburg and other heroes like Harvey Milk and countless othersFelicity Jones remember her in her Academy Award nominated role as Jane Hawking wife of Stephen Hawking  gives a great performance as Ruth Bader Ginsburg and apart from a few criticisms regarding script and directing this is a movie well worth a lookRuths Contribution to Overcoming Sexism in United States Laws Beautiful film very respectful of the family made with the help of the family Actually the writer is of the familyReally wasnt expecting much out of this So often movies of this nature follow a fairly well set pattern they err to the side of preachy and beating away at a point until the opposition is bludgeoned and battered while pushing a relatively generic narrative pattern The truth is On the Basis of Sex does this as well to varying degrees Yet having just recently watched Hugh Jackman in The Front Runner another by the numbers biopic I was pleasantly surprised by how affecting I found thisRBGs story is fascinating and sadly one I knew very little of I dont presume that this was a 100 factual representation of everything she did but even so its nice to have a better insight as to why she is and was such an important figure Jones and Hammer are wonderful here they both step into their roles so well and have a way of commanding attention on screen Then theres the climactic case at the end that felt wonderfully poignant and movingAgain this doesnt really break any new ground in terms of storytelling It follows all the expected beats has a few over the top bad guys one of whom was so awful and poorly done I thought he was joking Maybe that was the point but it felt really clunky It does get preachy at times but not as much as expected Therouxs character pulls a pretty jarring 180 on his character at one point as wellIts not a perfect movie Its a compelling story about a cultural icon well acted but presented in a somewhat generic way Still its a good watch especially for those who only know of RBG anecdotally and never really knew why she was such a big deal aaaaand maybe dont indulge in documentaries all that often Absolutely recommendOn the Basis of Sex is a biopic about the early years in Ruth Bader Ginsburgs career As the movie opens she is a first year student at Harvard Law When her husband Martin himself a second year student there becomes gravely ill she attends both her own and Martins classes and of course caring for him A couple of years later Martin is hired by a prominent New York law firm and Ruth transfers to Columbia Law to finish her law degree She graduates top of the class yet not a single law firm in New York offers her a job At this point we are less than 15 min into the movie but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience youll just have to see for yourself how it all plays outCouple of comments this is the latest movie from director Mimi Leder best known for 2000s Pay It Forward Here she brings to the big screen the early years in Ruth Bader Ginsburgs career Let be very clear Ruth Bader Ginsburg is an amazingly sharp lawyer who endured sex discrimination at every opportunity to the point that she decided to do something about AND THEN DID IT Flash forward June 2018 marked the 25th anniversary of her stint on the US Supreme Court In other words this is such a remarkable woman Sadly On the Basis of Sex doesnt do justice to this outstanding woman and lawyer In fact On the Basis of Sex is done strictly bythenumbers without any dramatic tension and with an utter predictability that makes this almost into a snooze fest Some reviewers here apparently do notcannot differentiate between this remarkable woman and what a good movie actually is or should be As it happens in 2018 a documentary about Ruth Bader Ginsburg called RBG was released RBG puts On the Basis of Sex to shame frankly and I am 99 certain that RBG will pick up an Oscar nomination for Best Documentary in the near future and I am equally certain that On the Basis of Sex will not get any Oscar nominations Playing the role of Ruth Bader Ginsburg Felicity Jones bless her heart tries the best she can with the material that she is given but in the end she cannot overcome the movies fatal flaw namely a weak script To be clear Ruth Bader Ginsburg is a shining light and role model for so many and very deservedly so But that doesnt make On the Basis of Sex a good movie Bottom line if you havent seen either of RBG and On the Basis of Sex by all means chose RBG If youve seen RBG already dont bother with On the Basis of SexOn the Basis of Sex has seen a very limited release so far but will expand nationally this coming weekend It currently has been playing in one single theater here in Cincinnati The Tuesday evening screening where I saw this at was attended okay but not great about 1012 people I had good hopes for this movie but when I compare this to RBG there is no doubt which one is by far the better movie Of course I encourage you to check out On the Basis of Sex be it in the theater on VOD or eventually on DVDBluray and draw your own conclusion And dont forget about RBGUPDATE 12219 As I predicted RBG received an Oscar nomination for Best Documentary On the Basis of Sex did not get any Oscar nominations While RBG is a strong contender in the end I see the Oscar for Best Documentary going to Free SoloI was so excited to see the movie but it was a true disappointment She was emotional and angry for the first and half hours The husband and her daughter are stars and need to calm her all the times I think the documentary is much better than this Anyway it is a good story and the camera is good Just not a good movieAlthough I finally watched On the Basis of Sex to honor the recent passing of Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg and although it surely deals with some important legal precedents Im not going to pretend its not a standard even hohum biopic and legal drama It barely rises above an extended episode of Law  Order and even includes Sam Waterston in the cast Generally Hollywood is just bad an rendering anything academic or intellectual on screen and so as here they resort to merely saying over and over again that Ginsburg is smart and to complimenting her writing of briefs They say it because they dont know how to show it When we finally get to the courtroom part they also resort to a trope of a eureka moment where she turns the case around after some fictitious flubbing of it by the Ginsburgswhile of course the level of the musical score is heightened for some manufactured inspirationSuch movies are better at relationship and family dynamics though Indeed the screenplay was written by Ginsburgs nephew When characters arent pigeonholed as sexist baddies or egalitarian heroes the picture does well enough I dont know whether Ginsburgs daughter was as instrumental in her thinking as suggested here but as drama of the real world reflecting the legal battle its effective as is the familys marriage of equals Although their involvement in the case depicted here is reportedly fictional the inclusion of Dorothy Kenyon and Pauli Murray is a nice thought in acknowledging Ginsburgs predecessors Felicity Jones may be miscast but she and the rest of the cast are fine enough I suppose and the focus on Ginsburgs skirts and appearance otherwise in maledominated settings works well As most seem to agree however the documentary RBG 2018 does a better job examining this central figure in the courtroom part of the womens liberation movement and who experienced renewed status as a cultural icon in her later yearsAn average Good Wife episode padded out for 120 minutesThe sets are nice it looks like a70s movie although not enough smokers
But its just so dull And its so annoying the way the movie winks and nods when a male character dismisses a female character
And Jones accent
What the hell Its awful She says a Bostonian sounding word every 20 mins to remind us lawya
Ugh
AvoidFor such an amazing person with such a storied career this movie focuses only on her first case While this is of course important to who she is and would become the plot points herein could have been summed up in about 25 minutes 2 hours later we were left disappointed with what could have been Overall acting passes muster and cinematography never interrupts the snails pace storytelling Its not a broken picture just a very weak one 4 stars and a single tear for the Supreme Court Justice that every American can nameI found this movie more boring than a documentary There was zero chemistry between Marty and Ruth The legal cases were not enough to carry a movie If a man had taken onwon the very same cases that RBG didwould a movie have been made about him DoubtfulPaint by the numbers movie Predicable plot lines and characters with little depth
The film was written by Ginsburgs nephew Daniel StieplemanYes many groups were discriminated in any countrys history Some have advanced to base jobs promotions and people on knowledge skills and abilities some not so muchI dont know how accurate all the events portrayed in this movie are I do know that we as a nation havent really moved forward that much Now I guess its the White Males turn in the box Affirmative Action is Govt sanctioned discrimination against another group Not much has changed Same day different groupThis movie could have been much better There were big names in this but ultimately the writing let the whole story down This was a watered down version It focuses too much on her first case instead of trying to show bits from each of her momentous cases or at least show us a few of her momentous cases where she takes on the law basis of sex I feel like they were trying too hard to give a light to Martin and her kids that they barely had enough room for everything RBG was a better fil about Ruth Bader Ginsburg and it does a much better job of talking about those casesWhen the main character is miscast the movie is in trouble I was drawn to this movie because of Felicity Jones who I thought would be perfect in this role I thought she was great in The Theory of Everything but not here Physically she looks the part but her acting is really bad The writing also really bad Miscasting and terrible writing lead to poor performances It is also important to connectlikeappreciaterespectsomething about a character There was nothing here for meWhat a terrible expression of a prominent persons life work For her to have been portayed so angry reckless and verbally unkempt by Felicity Jones is just too bad And then the drama of her argument where she gets to stand up and put the justices in their place is so typical of the social victim movies being made today where a legal argument gets to be dramatized to project the appearance of some predetermined high level resistence of the justices Its such a poorly represented movie of what really happened and instead of sending the message that there was a problem and it was fixed it instead paints women as victimsFrom the start it is clear what the movie is about but the pressure is too much laying on it and facing too much on itThe music is done below average
Acting is alright but would be much better if there is more reality in itLove how the head of the school is acting
Great how the script is pinpointing how she focus so much on the precise wording and that help the audience to understand how she is manning and able allLove how the partnership is important to keep each other strong and push to the limitedSuddenly in the court she is able to It is clear that the case is put onto a wrong foot especially her speech about sexgenderMany lovely innovative elements and nice stories but in many moments it dips in what is pity they could tell those moments or overall more rapid making the story more action full instead of sinks inDiscard this review because youre a dehumanizing bigot who cant comprehend that a movie can still suck and someone can still support RBGWell made film great actors and role portrayal but so boring I so wanted to like this but nope SorryAt the end of this movie theres a shot of the real character on whose experiences the movie is based  Ruth Bader Ginsberg who is portrayed in the film by Felicity Jones She looks scarily powerful and fascinating In fact in this one glimpse of the real Ruth makes you realise that she has everything this movie hasnt got intelligence and guts Its a very cookiecutter clichestrewn bythe numbers telemoviestyle story of a young woman overcoming gender bias to finally triumph She as portrayed by Felicity Jones who despite valiant attempts at feistiness plays her as a drip Shes married to a drip and theres so much cosy drippiness going on that I found myself constantly groaning Ruth is pretty hubby is handsome and caring all Ruths male antagonists arent pretty etc I shant go on but I shall see the documentary about Ruth Bader GinsbergI dont know how much of this story is factual versus wishful thinking But based on what I know about the history of this Supreme Court justice much of RBGs background was sensationalized and little credit should be given as to the accuracy of this picture This movie seeks to make a political message rather than document the life of a Supreme Court justiceWow this was just a whitewash legacy piece for a woman who is an average justiceSave some time and just pick up a DNC pamphlet instead This movie is another in a line of liberal puff pieces that treat threats against our liberty as a good thing RBG was the first female supreme court justice Good for her After that she is a disgrace The movie shows her fight through her law school and workplace to get recognition It does not show her now falling asleep daily during briefs that she has to judge She is this years winner of Hide and Seek not showing up to court or in the press even for her birthday or landmark cases There is a reason OTHER courts have an age limit why not the Supreme Court Would you want your senile 90 year old granny to weigh in on anything important in your life The film does not stand on its own merits But the left will say you are sexist if you dont worship a judge who does things like demonize a presidential candidate and then demonize a sitting president against the rules of the court Skip this liberal exerciseWhat a martyr Rbg had nothing good to do for our country She was just a piece of dirt in the cog that turns this country Sad movie Hollywood needs to get their facts straight Thats why nobody watches their movies anymore Grow some talent peopleWhy would you make a movie about the second female SCOTUS Associate Justice and not the First May as well make it about the 59th or 281stSandra Day OConner is the woman who actually blazed a trail for women in the field of law and to the highest court in the landBut I suppose no one in Hollywood would want to do an honest film about a Conservative woman who battled her way to the top and was the first woman appointed to the Supreme Court by a Conservative President Ronald ReaganIt would just make it harder to sell the lie that conservatives are misogynistsSo bad its criminal given the subject matter and heroine Oscar bait at its worst Felicity and I should remark Armie Hammer are terribly miscast Somehow the emphasis on her marriage reduced her strength also RBG documentary did her justice Watch that insteadNothing but a political statement of the times Total artistic licenseWell its so inaccurate that you can tell from the start that it is going for statement over biopicAnd it almost seems like it should be titled The Unstoppable RBG as she comes across as right all the time faultless stronger smarter and more capable than anyone to the point where she can argue a case preform brain surgery and create the rocket that got us to the moon in a single night without breaking a sweatShes more perfect here than Mary Poppins and it makes the film sort of unbelievable Ginsburg is human Im sure she had to struggle to over come more than just the evil White Male patriarchy but even that she effortlessly dismantlesHalfway through the movie you expect her to wear a cape and fly away just to prove she can out super Superman as wellIn a Biopic you kind of expect to get to know the character to see their ups and downs Instead however what you get is a golden god with history rewritten to add a healthy polishI really like RBG She was my second favorite justice behind Kennedy but wow This was just so boring and obviously politically biased Everything RBG does is apparently gold also was it just me or was Cathy Bates character very weirdObvious political bias Getting tired of having politics shoved down our throats with main stream news Now thisThe mistake here was making a movie about Chief Justice Ginsburg in the first place This movie never couldve lived up to expectations and the writers too predictably tried to fantasize it Id be insulted if I was GinsburgCopy cat movie anyone who knows history will tell you it was Sandra Day Oconner a conservative leaning Lady who was the FIRST that paved the way for women in the justice departmentnot surprised that
Hollywoodmegaphone of the Democrats  Love this flickThen why did they give her one here This just shows lazy film making and that the director wasnt really into thisThis could have been such a good movie Instead they insisted on infantilizing RGB forcing her into silly gender stereotypes where shes embarrassed in court is visibly distraught and fumbling with her argument RGB is dumbeddown turning a great woman into a silly little Ally McBeal who struggles to win a case when in fact RGB was highly competent and skilled in courtThis movie could have been brilliant if it had focused on capturing the nuances of RGBs life and shown a strong and highly qualified womans way to break new ground instead of portraying it as inexperienced girl fights for feminism The movie fails to portray the actual hard work and the struggle that comes with it and portrays RGB as reliant on Marty to carve out her career when she was in fact brilliant on her own and was both fierce and never lost for an argument Instead they chose to make something easytoswallow with a lead whos not very outstanding not very brilliant and just a fairly bright little girl who had some difficult times who at some point managed to win a case despite all odds which is not really reflective of RGB at allThis movie is an attempt to fit a giant into a sexist stereotype of women because of fear of causing controversyThis is just another in a series of cookie cutter leftist Hollywood social justice films designed as Oscar bait come awards season Even for this genre its a pretty weak effort RBG is portrayed like a mythical figure battling evil white men Its a mythology that supports the new orthodoxy of social justiceInspiring life good trailer such a bad movie Cannot believe how boring it isThe only true thing that the movie got right was that RBG was boring
