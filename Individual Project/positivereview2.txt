is 10 of 10DC made best superhero woman moviemy favorite üòçGal gadotPatty Jenkins Wonder Woman movie begins with a rocky uneven start But this very flawed pace allows the origin story of the amazonian warrior mature in a compelling build up and eventually navigate towards the rest of her story in a riveting seismic progression It gathers an affectionate sentimentality that sustains its potency even amidst the imposing explosive sequences that often triumph to take the audiences attention away from the oddly satisfying distraction that is Gal Gadot There are these resonating anthems that remain ablaze throughout the films 140minute duration love and peace sacrifice and courage and while it gets extremely preachy sometimes the narrative rarely gets boring Jenkins take on the genre doesnt abandon the idea of terror and mass destruction but it singularly escapes the confines of superhero clich√©s that eliminate its players moral form In Wonder Woman Diana Princes humanity is held by Gadots portrayal with a bracing commitment something she never loses even when confronted with the deceptive appeal of evil and darkness Her heroic verve gets an unexpected reinforcement from Chris Pines Steve Trevor with whom she shares a surprisingly inherent chemistry This is the first DC film in a very long time to ever sustain such visceral distinction a visual extravaganza brimming with heart and reasonDiana Princes story takes us to a mysterious island known as Themyscira hidden by Zeus in a protective dome of dim and mist far from the grasp of humanity She grows to believe that it is her sacred duty to protect her world not knowing such world will include what is beyond the clouds But when the first man arrives in a suspicious water crash landing she expands her understanding and begins to welcome the idea of defending whoever needs help in the other side But this eagerness barely entirely rests on a moral responsibility she believes that Ares the God of War and her inevitable nemesis is what causing the war waged by humans and she needs to kill him in order to restore peace to both worlds In one spinechilling moment within her breathtakingly choreographed fight sequence with Ares Diana rises from a fall and virtually carries out her meteoric ascent a symbolic assumption of her superhero statusBut in spite of the amount of physical tension and visual explosion Jenkins balances the flavor by injecting humor and romance utilizing them even in places where gripping action sequences are imminent Chris Pine shines in his own moments a remarkable feat for a character in a saga that seems to underscore women empowerment There is a powerful moment where he grapples for words to ask for Dianas help to win the war he practically breaks down a stirring and moving scene to behold Part of the films colossal allure is its heartit never loses it doesnt intend to and it grows to more aweinspiring forms as it reaches a resonating albeit predictable resolutionIt is ironic to think that Diana Prince isnt human but appears to be the most one when compared with her colleagues in the looming Justice League film In the end Wonder Woman isnt a film free of blemishes as it still stumbles upon political truths it rarely gets justified and minor expositions it doesnt seem interested to shed light on But it has soul humor and wonder a narrative spectacle one seldom finds in a film of its sortBefore becoming wonder women she was known as Diana the princess of the Amazons she was trained to be a warrior throughout her lifeLater learning and hearing about the outside world and begins to become the wonder women she isShe is a very strong independent girl from a small place super powerful and does all good for everyoneThis movie is everything a young girl needs to see while growing up Many people are going to try and tear it down saying its a stepback unrealistic or just simply dumb when its everything but It is empowering but yet so realistic funny and sad at the same time and of course we have the best female superhero of all time Wonder Woman is kind and compassionate brave and heroic and she doesnt have to be less to make people feel more Steve Travor is one of the best supporting characters ever and their romance feels real The story feels real The fact that its directed by a woman just adds to it  but because of the mere fact of Patty Jenkins being a woman  but for the movie being so amazingly shot and well directed The No Mans Land scene made me emotional such ways that not even Saving Private Ryan could There you go I said it
It felt like watching a real war movie didnt even feel like it was a superhero movie its definitely worth your time watch it its a movie for the agesGal Gadot is a real eye feast here smart strong superb clever and cool She is a real heroine here making each scene hers and adding a certain flair of fun and curious smirk which is both endearing and daring She gets her role well and her Wonder Woman is a true character of real strengthChris Pine is another must see here funny and clumsy at times but so good and so correct to be Steve Trevor His part is a great addition to Gals superior playingOthers are very well chosen too Danny Huston is great as usual his old school style serves well and David Thewlis is a must see surely soAll in all WW is a great flick spotless and no blemish found wow Excellent watchA pure adrenaline rush The movie has a very good story and VFXCasting direction and story are all good This movie will be admired by everyone A very good movie and a will be remembered for very longThis movie was amazing I watched an early screening and can say it was mind blowing Patty Jenkins is an amazing person This movie has all Drama Comedy and most of all amazing action with amazing effects Gal Gadot gave an amazing performance and Steve Trevor was magnificent After this movie I can say DCEU is back on trackI was never expecting less from this movie it was by far the best from DC
It is worth watchingAfter the big surprise that gave me Wonder Woman in Batman V Superman  again comes a surprise with her individual film An incredible plot  entertaining from the first moment Gal Gadot was born to play Wonder  Woman her performance was excellent I love her And Chris Pine as  Steve Trevor loved it The rest of the cast excellent Special effects  soundtrack costumes and 3D the best Ive seen for years Every  action scene is amazing I was surprised It is a film with love very  exciting inspiring and the best that made DC Comics that never failed  me Great surprise of the year and movie of the yearI watched this movie when it released and Now I could write a review for this movie When I watched i cant explain how a beautiful package of this movie Strong character strong acting the emotional was touching The action the visual were so Amazing So spectacular The stroy line how it could be This was much more than my expectation Love it so muchWhere do I even start with this one From the cinematography acting story VFX symbolism using color No Mans Land symbolism in general character arcs I could go on and on Wonder Woman at least in my opinion not only is the best DCEU film not only the best superhero film but the best and my personal favorite film I have ever ever seenThis was absolutely amazing They hardly gave anything away in the trailer The actors where amazingthe story line was well thought outI havent watched a good movie in a long time and this was worth the wait I would highly recommend this to anyone I feel like it will appeal to a lot of people from different backgroundsThis is the best movie of 2017 beyond a shadow of a Doubt This movie blew me away The action scenes are godlike humor falls into place so perfectly Gal Gadot as Wonder Woman is as good as Hugh Jackman for Wolverine born to play these roles Steve Trevor and Diana Prince chemistry is so legit that it surpasses major Romantic hits Nonetheless its a Superhero Movie and boy it delivers on that front Every Guy Woman KidsDammit Everyone needs to Watch this Movie You will cry happy tears that one the most iconic Superheroes has made its Film Debut with such a Blast Hats off to Patty Jenkins and co for delivering the Superhero Movie of the year I am not kidding Guess what Marvel Fanboys are already at it giving this Masterpiece Mediocre reviews This Movie is not Mediocre Its not even Good ITS Fn GREAT Even if you are not a fan of DCEU youll be flabbergasted blown away Rejoice in this Wonderful adventure of a Wonderful WomanWe begin with Diana regaining possession of that old photo of her she so eagerly wanted in BvS then flashback to Princess Diana as a child who yearns to be like the rest of the Amazons of Themyscira Her mother Queen Hippolyta Connie Nielsen is hesitanthiding something from her but eventually allows her sisterDianas aunt Antiope Robin Wright to train her to be better than the rest of the Amazons She proves herself to be just that and so much more After Diana rescues Steve Trevor Chris Pine whose crashed plane from World War I penetrated Themysciras shieldcloak their two worlds collide Once Steves subjected to the Lasso of Truth Pines equal parts amusingutterly believable when under its influence Dianas convinced the Amazons old enemy Ares the God of War is behind the war Steve speaks of and is determined to help the world of manGal Gadots Wonder Woman was the standout in BvS and proves the skeptics incorrect about that simply being a fluke due to her limited screentime This movie rests on her shoulders and Gadot proves more than up to the task of portraying Diana as bravecourageousintelligentbadass and most of all deeply empatheticcompassionate not just regarding people but animals too She radiates warmth and her performance is at times heartbreaking especially during the really emotional scenes Gadot also has good comedic timingdelivery of lines like when she discovers ice cream and is just so likable endearingly earnest but genuine Everything a hero should be unlike other certain socalled superheroesPines Steve is far more likable than his Kirk He does a lot with what couldve been a thankless role and like Diana Steve proves himself a hero He helps Diana adjust to being in a new world teachingexplaining things to her but is never condescending Both actors click especially in the boat scene when leaving Themyscira They have an easy chemistry their banter is fun and SteveDianas respective fishoutofwater scenarios allow for some amusing moments without verging into silliness They respect each other neither one is ever portrayed negatively to prop up the other even when they argue and its one of the only comic book movie romantic pairings thats been developed over the course of just one movie which Ive found truly believablehas actually had any emotional impactSteves secretary Etta Candy also provides some humour though thankfully isnt too annoying She takes an instant liking to Diana you can see why and Diana respects her in return See other comic cook movies Mutual respect between characters isnt THAT hard Steves other trusted reinforcements only get small amounts of screentime but each feel like fullydevelopedproper characters with depthflaws The camaraderie that forms between them and Diana is earnedbelievable bringing real heart to the storyOn the villains side theres Danny Hustons Ludendorff who Diana believes to be Ares thus providing Diana with an adversary she can beat upsomeone you really want to see her kick the arse of Even better though is Elena Anaya as Doctor Maru aka Doctor Poison she and Ludendorff make a truly twisted pair with a sick sense of humour that at least makes them more memorable than the typical comic book villains Ive been impressed with Anayas previous work and she conveys so much whilst acting with half her face behind a mask In a scene she shared with Steve I even felt for her Pine does well here too I appreciated the moment between her character and Diana near the end and that it didnt go quite the way one mightve expectedWhile the Amazons are only in the beginning of the movie they still make a strong impression Witnessing them in action is quite something to behold Despite Hippolyta and Diana often disagreeingarguing with each other Gal Gadot and Connie Nielsen completely sell the love their characters feel for each other as well as ALL the Amazons At first David Thewlis feels underutilized as Sir Patrick who helps DianaSteve but later on shares a scene with Diana through a window that I thought was visually interestingThe music throughout the film packs an emotional punch and those complaining about overuse of the awesomely memorable Wonder Woman Theme which we got a taste of in BvS and this films trailers need to hush as its only used sparinglyat the RIGHT times mostly during the epic fight scenes proving almost as iconic as the Superman Theme Speaking of this movie gives us something different with the heros style of fighting Her use of sword shield bulletdeflecting bracelets as well as the Lasso of Truth makes for some stunninginventive action sequencesRegarding complaints of too much CGI during the climax given who was fighting who and the power at their disposal the effects on display were justified The Wonder Woman costume doesnt get enough credit for being true to the comic whilst also being functionalnongratuitousnonexploitative no starspangled panties here The first time she shows it off in the No Mans Land sequence is very memorable Not only is it one of the movies best scenes but it also deserves to be right up there alongside the first time Superman saves Lois as far as immediately iconic theres that word again sequences go Dianas other costumes are also gorgeous as is Themyscira Paradise Island indeed The film feels like a classic actionadventure movie Its wellpaced has plenty of heart and is indeed one of the best comic book movies in LONG timeNaturally itll have its detractorsnitpickers but this is one movie where the hype is warrantedto be believed Its everything Ive been waiting forwanting to see in a superhero movie for so long This isnt just easily the best DCEU movie so far nor is it simply an excellent superhero movie its also a triumph for the first big screen adaptation of Wonder Woman and an enthralling cinemagoing experienceone of the best movies in recent memory Everyone involved with this film should feel proudpat themselves on the back for this accomplishmentNot gonna lie when I first saw the Wonder Woman trailer I was like oh dear hear comes another disaster of DC films I truly had no faith in DC after the three bad movies that came before it So I went into the cinema expecting another Zack Slimer film OH MY GOSH was that a treat for the eyes Not only ere the visuals and soundtrack score on point but the characters were likable and the acting was really good I 101 recommended watching this film So much happens that is just amazing Thank you DC You have restored my faith in your movies Who doesnt love a girl power action film done well This was kick ass In a cheesy and wonderfully fantastical way The action sequences were great I loved WW in every scene  1010 entertainment My only wish was to see more colour and less of the British dullness But yeah wow A lot of fun I am a fan of DC even their films although I personally love them I can understand a lot of their criticisms and recognize theyre not the best superhero films So going in I was excited but also realistic in that I try to not have my expectation too highAnd boy I was not disappointed I had an absolute blast watching it The action is amazing the shots were beautifully shot and directed The highlight of the film is of course Gal Gadot and Chris Pines who both owned the roles of Wonder Woman and Steve Trevor Even the supporting cast provided some great humor and depth it really made me care about each charactersThe only gripe I had was there was some disappointment with the antagonist The antagonist is not bad in anyway in fact the antagonist is visually cool looking but I realize that the antagonist is not the best villain good but just disappointedAll in all it is easily one of the best blockbuster films this year had an amazing time So go out and watch it youll sure find something entertaining out of itAwesome story and awesome actingbest movie of 2017Wonder Woman Two words HELL YEAH Gal Gadot as if it wasnt clear enough with her performance in BvS absolutely nailed it as Diana and the rest of the cast was stellar as well The story of how she transformed into who she is today is PHENOMENAL This movies got heart humour at just the right places take note Marvel and the action Oh boy does it rock when there are action setpieces Jenkins did an incredible job with it Snyder along with the other screenwriters gave us a story that does all the justice in the world to Wonder Womans character and mythos Definitely a 1010 Take that DC hatersThe movie shows us the story of Princess Diana before we all know her as the wonder woman All was well in her place when one day she came in contact with an air fighter and knows that there is more in this world than her place so she goes forward to fulfill her destinyThe story line was excellent the perfect plot executed really well Maybe a little lengthy in some places but it was compromised with all those funny lines At the beginning I was hesitant to watch this movie after my horrible experience with Batman vs Superman but this turned out to be excellent While seeing this movie I forgot it was a DC movie felt more like it was a Marvel movie because usually a Marvel movie turns out to be so good The ending of the movie was unpredictable and good Gal Gadot did a perfect job as the wonder woman hats off to her Looking forward to the DC movie Justice league with great expectations Yes I would recommend everyone to watch this movie do not miss thisNotable ActingGal Gadot famous for her acting in Batman vs Superman Furious 7 and many moreChris Pine famous for his acting in the Star Trek series and many moreRobin Wright famous for her acting in the movie Forrest Gump and many moreConnie Nielsen famous for her acting in the movie the Gladiator and many moreMy Rating 1010WonderWoman movie is simply amazing It doesnt hold back it pulls out all the stops it doesnt reserve some parts for a potential sequel it fully gives you this iconic Amazonian Warrior princess in all her glory Youll be constantly blown away by what she can do because the film is constantly eager to show them to you Gal Gadot has cemented her star power and the DC Cinematic Universe has redeemed themselves through Wonder WomanStarring Gal Gadot Chris Pine Robin Wright Connie Nielsen David Thewlis directed by Patty Jenkins before she was Wonder Woman she was Diana princess of the Amazons trained to be an unconquerable warrior in the mythical island of Themyscira But Diana is unaware of her true identity When an American pilot crashes on their shores and tells of a massive war raging in the outside world Diana feels compelled to join him and fight alongside mankind to stop the threat and kill who she blames to be the cause of such destruction the god of war AresBecause its a DC movie much of the visual and the style of Wonder Woman is what youd expect from a DC movie But whats great about this one which by the way the other installments unfortunately failed to do is that Wonder Woman manages to inject entertainment so its not all brooding and dark and depressing like the way theyve turned boyscout Superman intoAnd I think much of that is thanks to the fishoutofwater aspect This is a woman who comes from a place which has a significantly different culture than ours And halfway through the end the fishoutofwater aspect becomes less about literally not fitting in and more about her misunderstood perception of us mankind So perhaps Wonder Woman is an example of a success story that happens when you dont give all the control to Zack Snyder and when studio heads dont meddle with the mythology and the filmmakers vision and when things are not forced or rushed The result is a story which you can tell has been given a considerable amount of thought processAny doubt anybody may have had about Gal Gadot playing this role will fade away the minute she steps into the screen Not only does she look the part shes absolutely gorgeous her acting is sharp she also performs the action sequences with strength and elegance She becomes Wonder Woman they are now inseparable just like were all going to have a hard time imagining somebody else other than Hugh Jackman as WolverineLogan This is Wonder Womans debut on the big screen billions of girls and women on earth look up to her as their hero they have been anticipating this moment for years so it is a huge responsibility one that I think Gadot gracefully carries Kudos to WB and DC Entertainment for entrusting this to female filmmaker Patty Jenkins who does an excellent job because more than just it being a great superhero film Wonder Woman is a very wellmade film Its spectacular in every sense of the word Ramas Screen Go and watch it Its the best addition to the DCEU yet Gal and Chris have great chemistry all the actors performances are superb the music was MAGICAL and when the film ended I wanted moreBut I suggest not to bring your little ones to see it though There are war scenes that may be too intense for themI personally loved watching it and I plan to watch it again for the THIRD time in the cinemas this weekendThis film is a masterpiece such a fantastic piece of art it embodies the persona of Wonder Woman that we know and love from the comics and TV shows alike The scenery is magnificent from the islands of Themyscara to the ambiance of World War III Enjoyed every minute of the film in theater Recommend it to any movie goerThis movie is amazing because I love Wonder Woman and its one of my favorite superhero films I feel like anyone who watches this movie will really enjoy it because it has so much action and emotion the fighting scenes are really well executed and super intense This movie has such a good storyline too and it makes you feel so many emotions Its about World War 1 and how they overcome the war with the help of Wonder Woman Even though its fiction its still really inspiring We see a lot of the trials that people had to face during the war and not even to the full extent of their hardships This movie was a good source of entertainment because many people love superheroes My favorite part about this movie was the main character played by Chris Pine because I love him and hes a great actor There is no part in this movie I didnt like because its just that good I love superheroes so I like to watch other movies like this one The filming was pretty great they got all the scenes just right and especially the fighting scenes those were my favoriteIf you like superhero ish movies then this is a good match for you so what are you waiting for and go right ahead and watch this movie if youve got some spare time leftLooking at these reviews i felt i had to write one myself All i see is marvel fans saying how bad this film isTrust me this is a good watch i watched in cinema and at home both times i enjoyedthe beginning is a good introduction of wonder woman and the AmazoniansIf you are looking for a good action film with a good cast and story this is it The scenery is amazing and the action scenes look amazing there are even funny scenes in this filmDont listen to the haters who feel threatened by this film just watch and enjoy as i have and othersSo in the current era where the media and Hollywood really try to give us more movies with female main characters Wonder Woman is for me the main and only example of how to get it right How  Simple Actual character development through a good story and good writing and likable side characters Especially Steve Trevor played by Chris Pine The visuals are great although at the end I question the CGI for Ares but the reason Im giving it only 9 stars is because the villains are nothing to write home about They get the job done but thats it Theyre still better than Steppenwolf thoughIts a pretty good movie as you probably have already heard if you follow the reviews I was a bit worried DC has shown a shall we call it tendency  to darken every comic book character to the point where Suicide Squad had everyone with a sad backstory It made me miss the cheery disposition of Caesar Romeros Joker Yes I get it that youre a sociopath Cant you enjoy itWonder Woman avoids that In the midst of the horrors of the Great War there are real jokes and moments of kindness and great deeds inspired by naive moralityVisually the movie combines the splash panels and covers of the Dark Horse era of DC with some canny casting choices among the secondary characters Lucy Davis looks like Etta Candy from the late WWII comics era Ewen Bremner looks like Charlie from the same era both push the comic book look to the edge without falling overMiss Gadot turns out to be a very capable screen performer with dark expressive eyes Chris Pine restrains himself as her leading man If the screenplay sometimes falls into the current hackneyed tropes it plays nimbly with others like Chekhovs Gun If the final battle is another round of RockEmSockEm Robots the earlier battle scene fought in righteous anger made me think about the Angel of MonsWonder Woman  Saying that this is the best of the new DC films isnt exactly glowing praise Saying that it now currently holds my highest score of the year however would definitely qualifyThe dramatic and comedic tones were perfectly balanced Such a glaring omission from the previous DC offerings was any real feeling of levity Here jokes were well timed and delivered even better Gal Gadot and Chris Pines chemistry was automatic making these backandforths all the more believable And Lucy Davis steals the show as Pines secretaryThere is something to be said for the theme song of this movie Do me a favor and try to hum the theme to the Avengers How about Captain America The most recent Spiderman maybe I might not be able to pick any of those out of a lineup Wonder Womans theme is visceral and will be immediately recognizable after youve heard it Its featured in key moments of the film adding to the weight of the already powerful actionSimilar to most of the Marvel films this one has a weak villain A German officer is presented as the antagonist but I felt more like it was just war in general that they were fighting against I definitely liked the payoff but he was underwhelming as an adversaryThe only other negative I can think of is that there are some moments of wonky special effects It took me back to The Matrix Reloaded where Neo is just a computer animated cartoon knocking around a dozen Agent Smiths with a stick The effects seemed jarringly dated at timesDC was in an absolute tailspin up to this point The last three films received critic ratings of 55 27 and 25 This could have been the nail in the coffin Instead it was an absolute B12 shot to the brand and the studio itself Box office hauls of future DC films will no doubt be bigger because of this movie And to think I almost stayed away from this one based on Batman v Superman alone Now Wonder Woman is the only reason Ill keep DC in my lineup going forward 87510Last evening I saw Wonder Woman and it met and exceeded my expectations marvelously Gal Gadot shines on screen as the Amazon Princess with an excellent supporting castThe chemistry between her and co lead Chris Pine is wonderful You could very easily enjoy this film without seeing any of the previous films or will realize it as the best of its franchise to date Have no fear that this will be boring because of the period the film takes place init matters not Creators of the film benefit greatly by staying true to the source material that has encapsulated audiences since Diana Princes debut in comics over seven decades ago As well as DC comics own Geoff Johns joining the production team Wonder Woman is done justice as she serves Justice by the amazing combat Sequences shot by Director Patty Jenkins and the score compliments the screen accordinglyI dont need humor in a film about a hero  nor do enjoy it when its forced into a story The humor in Wonder Woman is well placed and most called for and appreciated The same goes for the action in this film it is not overdone nor is it to much or to little it is just right  This movie benefits from an exciting story heroic characters that are enjoyable and most credible vile villains I want to see it again and cant wait to see Wonder Woman in Justice League this NovemberIts a brandnew month and you know what that means right Yes another super hero movie to kick off the summer blockbuster season This time it isnt Marvel cranking out the comic book cinematic feature but their rivals DC studios With its recent shaky track record the DC cinematic universe hasnt gotten the best publicity in terms of quality So the studio has decided to get the leading lady herself to pave the way Yes todays review is on Wonder Woman starring Gal Gadot and Chris Pine Can this movie break the bad luck streak of DCWB studios Robbie K here to share some opinions on the matter so lets get started shall weLIKES1 Gal Gadot is incredible and steals the show with her poise pizazz and acting talents A fantastic casting direction that really brings the woman to wonder to life in beauty ferocity and bouts of heroism aka kicking bad guy butt Acting stunts and an onpoint delivery of her lines makes this actress one of the tops in my book2 The action is on point for most of the movie filled with impressive displays of weaponry martial arts and historical warfare Wonder Womans battles held such emotion managing to bring the suspense all while delivering that feel good post battle high you might have gotten from reading a comic book The team brings some fastpaced thrills we have wanted for almost a year and a half3 A good representation for girls I may have already said this but this movie targets a wide variety of audience members in some form or manner Yet this reviewer has to give props for the design of a character that is certainly worthy of representing the female super heroes and inspiring the female population that they certainly can do anything 4 Comedic timing Its not going to be a super hero movie at least in this day and age without some laughs to break up the tension Wonder Woman continues this trend filling the void with welltimed oneliners a few awkward encounters that often deal with sex and some slapstick gimmicks that do the job well 5 Character Development I know most super hero movies have this element but there is something about Wonder Woman that stood out to me This film managed to spin Dianas character development into a roller coaster ride of feelings that almost made me tear up Her journey to discovering herself and her role into this new world was poetically portrayed using multiple angles to get the job done It could have also been due to the powerful soundtrack the visual effects or maybe Gadots acting but it really worked for me 6 Fast Pace We all know those movies that drag and yes Im talking much of DCs library Not the case for this film The nearly 150minute run time flew by for much of the movie having me at one point saying Dang its already been 90 minutes Not something I often say DISLIKES1 Unoriginality Youll find that Wonder Woman shares a lot with Captain America First Avenger The setup setting and build up almost matching outside of the weapon of choice and martial arts moves Certainly not the biggest limitation but something that others have been bothered by 2 Almost pointless crew The crew that joins Diana held such promise in the picture but it was dropped so hard in this movie Outside of Chris Pine the other members do little for the overall mission outside of a few throws some tracking and mainly comedic relief There were hints at character development and deeper dynamics but they fizzled out faster than sparkler at 4th of July I know this movie is about Wonder Woman but why even include these guys if that was the goal 3 Preachy Some reviews state the whole feminismmales are pigs is overdone and to an extent I agree Yet the bigger dislike was the preachy monologues that sometimes plagued this film A few times the heat of the moment was lost in a display of selfreflection which is great but not in the midst of a battlefield Some of these moments also had that eyerolling factor for me 4 Overuse of CGI I like special effects I like stunts but I dont like overuse of a gimmick The slowmotion interludes during the action scenes added some cool emphasis to Wonder Womans skills alongside some cool finishing moves Somewhere along the production someone got a little trigger happy with the effect and used a little too much for me and soon started disrupting the cool stunts they had Gal do In addition there were some special effects that were a bit cheesy and took the edge off of Wonder Woman Learn from Michael Bay people too much of special effects makes for many jokes 5 The ending Dont turn away hear me out The ending is great on many levels emotional prowess role model and morals However it lost the momentum the first few fights had with them trading suspense for flashy special effects drawn out banter and unimpressive choreography Sort of felt like the ending to Xmen apocalypse where the bad guys bark was worse than his bite The VERDICTWonder Woman delivers on many levels and breaks the mediocre displays that DC has cranked out over the last year Its emotional its dynamic its fun and it provides a solid role model for admirable heroes I feel the movie met most of my expectations and I was happy with the overall product Its far from perfect though and still has a few things to tighten up like developing other characters balancing the CGI use and keeping the momentum going Still I have to recommend this one for a theater visit especially you comic lovers out thereWONDERful No seriously this is an excellent film And Im just not talking about the superhero genre DC finally hit a homer with this one This film also serves as evidence that Zack Snyder can WRITE a great story but should probably stay out of the directors chair Warner Bros and Ratpac Dunes¬†Wonder Woman is the superhero film we needed Trailing so far behind the Marvel brand and film quality DC needed to produce a film that would make up for¬†Batman v Superman and¬†Suicide Squad AND catch up to Marvel Seemingly setting out to accomplish the impossible this film exceeded all measurable expectations and provided a comprehensive cinematic experience With many themes this film hits on many topics and does so with incredible precision and elegance Its almost as if this film is an extension of Diana Prince herself Never addressed or referenced as Wonder Woman actually Diana Princes origin story is powerful and ever so apropos in todays sociopolitical climate If only we could all have the courage compassion and determination that Wonder Woman embodies and represents Ever since her creation in 1941 by psychologist William Marston Wonder Woman has always been treated the best when all preexisting inhibitions typically added to a female character in a mans role are removed allowing the feminist ethos at her core to shine and erupt with unbridled passion and strength Among other traits the chief characteristic that separates her from other superheroes in both the Marvel and DC universes respectively isno not her genderit is her ability to integrate truth justice compassion and courage in everything she does to protect the planet entrusted to her people by the Greek gods The key to understanding Wonder Woman is not through her brute strength or supernatural powers but through her love and compassion for innocent people and her own integrity Rarely has any film truly given women or anyone for the matter a strong female protagonist who does not pander but exhibits excellence in welldeveloped strength of character and a complete eruption of the fantasies of many women to rise up to serve and protect It would have been far too easy to sell Diana Prince as a vengeful women out to destroy men or seek revenge for the destruction that has befallen the planet but no that is not the Diana we see We see a heroine of othersa completely unselfish hero who is of earth Being of the earth is truly what separates her from someone like Super Man Sure some strong female characters from with the world of comics literature theatre TV or film have demonstrated strong characteristics and have been leaders but¬†Wonder Woman sands alone as a film that provides audiences with a female protagonist who is not merely a leader but the engineerthe authorof her own destiny and storyWhy does this film work so well After all that is the question you are likely asking yourself after so many DC flops note that does not count the Burton or Nolan films The short answer is that Snyder was NOT in the drivers seat on this ride however there is more to it than that Snyders touch is certainly evident in many scenes especially the action sequences furthermore he was greatly instrumental in the overall structure but he took a backseat to the driver of this vehicle His approach was important in the design of the car and even building it but when it came time to take it for a spin he turned the steering wheel over to Director Patty Jenkins Films featuring strong female protagonists most often seem to fair better when there is a women at the helm And¬†Wonder Woman is a testament to that observation Whereas a male director would have likely spent some time sexualizing Diana Jenkins spends the time on her courage and compassion Instead of focusing on the terrain of Dianas mystical home beautifully appointed with white cliffs and sapphire water or spending time on her sleek blade or even her trademark lasso of truth Jenkins spends a significant amount of screen time on the terrain of Dianas face A face that communicates the heart mind and soul of Diana Instead of a face displaying anger or disgust at the world of men her face is often bright hopeful containing a winning smile with eyes overflowing with optimism In terms of the production design itself it only bares hints of Snyders penchant for beautiful music videos the production design is one that takes itself seriously but in the perfect amounts Although the film is quite dark there are sufficient moments of levityPerhaps youre a stereotypical dude who does not care for films that feature female protagonists and feministic themes No fear¬†Wonder Woman is actually a World War I film disguised as a superhero movie As much as¬†Wonder Woman works as an exceptional superhero movie it is equally an impressive World War I film Taking place in the days leading up to Armistice Day this film displays the atrocities of war and the determination of both sides to win You will find yourself in the trenches in France and Belgium with the Allied forces who against all odds are determined to defeat the enemy in order to stop genocide and widespread devastation Placing Wonder Woman amidst the warriors of earth connects her to humanity in ways that most superheroes cannot Fighting for what you believe in is a major theme in this film Some of the best war movies are those that show dont tell And¬†Wonder Woman certainly shows what war really looks like instead of talking about it as some abstract concept or spending time in diplomacy In fact diplomacy is thrown out the window and Diana lays the need to fight on the hearts of the bureaucratic leaders and soldiers alike Pick up your sword and fight Dont just sit idly by while humanity is destroyedWonder Woman is certainly one of the best if not THE BEST superhero adventure recently released by the cinema industry The film is a comic book on the big screen with a very well written screenplay and a very attractive and full of action story The cast is fantastic and Gal Gadot and Chris Pine show a wonderful chemistry with their never boring romance The beauty of the charming Gal Gadot is exotic and sexy she really steals the show with her perfect performance The topnotch special effects is stateofart and impressive The direction of Patty Jenkins surprises since this is her first blockbuster work My vote is nineTitle Brazil Mulher Maravilha Wonder WomanJust watched the first show and everybody started clapping when the credit started to roll in the end That says a lot about a movieMany of us had doubt when Gal Gadot was cast as Wonder Woman and she proved the worth What an amazing cast Hollywood is full of beautiful actresses but Gal also has a great personality which resonates with her character very well She is strong as well as funny Chris Pine turned out to be the perfect sidekick and love interest of Diana He has this old classic Hollywood look I am hoping we will see more of Connie Nelson and Robin Wrights character in the next venture I dont want to go further into screenplay It has its tiny flaws but we have seen much worse in recent times Many people might argue why the WWI Well the core of the movie is not the war but the darkness inside us that causes the war You can easily relate it to todays narrative I enjoyed the movie through and through Finally a quality superhero movie from DC after Batman Trilogy You go GalA movie beyond woman equality history war ethics and even religion This movie was behind its veil about honor duty good evil doing what is right and of course love I have never seen so profound aspects in another fictitious hero movie A masterpiece on its kindThis in my opinion makes this hero movie go up to the top sharing places with The Dark Knight As what Ive seen so far on my 29 year old life spanHaving become mightily bored by the glut of formulaic American super hero movies with their incoherent plots appalling dialogue and suspect morality only ever partially redeemed by their creative visuals and incredible special effects I had no desire to subject myself to yet another But the weather was so hot today I whisked my ten year old nephew to the only family movie in our local air conditioned cinema Immediately this new world was a visual treat and the necessary background to WW unfolded like a Greek myth A few hints of the Amazonian women swaggering like chaps in their training camp and a couple of corny lines from WW love interest Chris Pine delivered in the expository style early on started to eat away at my disbelief but these minor grumbles didnt portend and the movie grew in drama spectacle tension and intensity My young companion turned to me saying this movie is amazing and I agree Gal Gadot and Pine are both credible actors its not his fault hes too pretty to be a real hero and they are well served by an above average script especially for this kind of movie David Threwlis brings serious acting chops to the table as expected but the revelation is Lucy Davis whose comedic sidekick could carry a show of her own The audience loved her and laughed along at every nuance Her charisma bounced out of the screen and reminded me of the superb character actors of the old studios in the decades before the end of that system eg Eve Arden Margaret Rutherford Mary Wickes Joan Blondell et al Stardom awaits I wont overplay the feministgirl power angles but if my ten year old nephew loved it as he did then I can confidently say most young boys will too Drag them there the girls too Its a joyWow Wonder Woman just blew me away The casting was great especially Gal Gadot Cris Pine Robin Wright and Connie Nielsen And also the decision to use WW1 backdrop and how well it was portrayed was just perfectThe movie has a raw feel to it which makes it extra special Not a moment will go by where youll think they tried too hard to fit in the humor it all comes as natural as natural can be There is a lot of little moments in the movie that can be appreciated like for example the dancing in midst of war the romance between Wonder Woman and Steve Trevor Moreover the action alone can be a driving factor which makes me want to watch this movie again and again Its one like that weve never seen beforeYes this movie is not perfect it has few a few CGI issues which I think all big action movies have in common including Marvel movies as well however with Wonder Woman its handled really wellI honestly appreciate the hard work and passion that went behind making this movie possible Some of the people to credit will be Petty Jenkins wonderful director Zack Snyder for having good vision for these movies and the screen writers Wonder Woman is a mustsee movie on big screensCue that awesome theme music Gal Gadot plays Diana Princess of Themyscira and daughter of Hippolyta Best known as Wonder WomanAnd by god she kills it in this Wonder Woman is not merely the best installment of the DCEU so far but its probably the best DC movie since the Dark Knight trilogy Wonder Woman is also one of the most entertaining superhero debuts since the first Guardians of the Galaxy On top of that there is finally an excellent movie to set the benchmark for future superhero movies about a female heroDirector Patty Jenkins transports audiences to Paradise Island where Amazon warrior women are tasked to defend mankind from the vengeful Ares the Greek god of war Their rulers daughter Diana is kindhearted brave compassionate and courageous She rescues a dashing spy named Steve Trevor Chris Pine who informs her people about a greater conflict we know to be World War One She is appalled by the destruction and onslaught so without question she sets out on a quest to end itGal Gadot is the beautiful beating heart of this movie and perfectly cast as Wonder Woman Shes charismatic and authoritative but not so much that she loses her feminine charm and sense of humor Yes a DC character being funny Imagine that Chris Pine is the love interestsidekick who could honestly serve as the lead of his own adventure movie Pine is factory built for these types of tough but clever action roles His chemistry with Gadot is the best romance in a superhero movie since probably the original SpiderMan movies The supporting cast is a strong one Connie Nielsen is dignified as the Queen Robin Wright is her steely lieutenant Danny Huston is a slimy Nazibyanothername Elena Anaya is her creepy henchwoman and Lucy Davis plays the comic reliefThe movie uses the wartime setting to its advantage No Mans Land becomes Diana Princes debut as Wonder Woman German infantry fight Amazons on horseback Later the finale boils down to a god versus another god And yes they use the Lasso of Truth Its so cool The timing of this movie couldnt be better It works splendidly as a summer blockbuster at the very least But it gives hope to female viewers young and old that women can be heroes too It gives male viewers a chance to see a true ideal feminist hero in action It also redresses for the mistakes made in the previous installments of the DCEU and honestly makes me more excited for Justice LeagueThe moment Diana Prince took her first spear tackle at evil in Batman Vs Superman threw a gauntlet at the feet of an entire generation of older moviegoers whos lingering impression of Wonder Woman was a soft curvaceous and inherently feminine Linda Carter of the seventies Spinning magic girl transformations have been replaced with a monstrous power that frankly woke me up in my seat She was my lingering impression and my first taste of a DC that left me wanting moreThe Wonder Woman role has big shoes to fill and sadly the shoes themselves will give her a scrutiny male counterparts are not burdened with Will they be sensible shoes combat boots or heels Gal Gadots counterargument is a role that is strong personal and honest Her tremendous power is counterbalanced with a naivety that reaches beyond comic relief into an often scathing critique of the human leanings toward inhumanity She reminds us of a bigger picture by becoming a passionate observer of our frailty and in doing so often exposes her own while retaining all of her strength In this regard the role of Wonder Woman is an unprecedented success as she struggles to find herself as a person rather than her role as a female superheroAlthough aspects of female gender roles are present they develop in other characters The mother the amazon the witch the submissive  all present as people rather than stereotypes and the roster of strong performances delivers with a confidence that define these women with substance and a dignified strength while avoiding becoming lessons or cautionary tales in femininityI feel it as important to note that the male characters in this movie also avoid the same gender stereotypes The men who marginalize her share the same disregard for all life The men who initially sought to protect her  as we are taught to by our mothers and sisters  quickly fall behind her and support her strength She is never forced to explain herselfIn a genre filled with movies about other movies or stories that build momentum for bigger stories to come its refreshing to see a movie that delivers a strong tale genuinely warm characters and manages to embarrass us with the lesson that genuinely strong and honest characters make our gender expectations irrelevantWonder Woman was not created by Aphrodite or Zeus but was rather the brainchild of a controversial psychologist and inventor William Moulton Marston Marstons other claim to fame is the invention of the lie detector Although Superman and Batman were selling well to kids there was a wave of pseudopsychology which claimed that comic books were poisoning the minds of impressionable youths Detective Comics later renamed DC were frightened that these radical groups were influencing the voting public which might hire lawmakers to ban comic books altogether DC hired Marston to address this problem Rather than changing existing comic books Marston offered an unexpected solution make a female superhero ie a superheroine The result was Wonder WomanLittle did DC comics know Marston had been involved in the early suffragette and birthcontrol movements of the early 20th century and he incorporated much of the iconography and symbolism into the comic book Wonder Womans looks was originally a hybrid of the Varga pinup girl posters of the 1940s and Suffragettes of the early 20th century For example Wonder Womans early adventures often involved her being chained an icon used by feminists and suffragettes in the early 20th century in propaganda posters and political illustrations When chained Wonder Woman loses her powers Her magic lasso compels the person being lassoed to tell the truth an obvious reference to Marstons lie detector The comic was an instant hit and even became iconic for the Womens Liberation Movement of the 1970sFastforward to 2017 Patty Jenkins has directed an outstanding film on a screenplay by Allan Heinberg from a story by Heinberg Zack Snyder and Jason Fuchs based on the DC Comics character Starring Gal Gadot as the title character and Chris Pine as Steve Trevor this superhero action film flies as fusing of Ancient mythology and human history and the offering is one of the best of the genre since the original Superman film starring Christopher Reeve 1979 Like Superman Wonder Woman begins with the backstory of the title character Her name is Diana daughter of Queen Hippolyta Connie Nelson and she lives on Paradise Island where only women reside whose culture is a throwback to Ancient Greek mythology Paradise because there are no men to screw things up Diana as a youth is taught by the best combat teacher of the island General Antiope Robin Wright in the ways of combat and becomes the best among her peersSticking to the origins Captain Steve Trevor an American spy working for the British is being chased by Germans during the First World War and crashes off the coast of Paradise Island He has in his possession plans written by Dr Poison a real character from DC Comics After a confrontation between Amazons and the Germans Trevor is taken in by the Amazons and forced to reveal who and what he is Eventually Diana decides she must go with Trevor back to the world of men and help stop the war Her reasons are mythological in which she must stop the God of War Of course Trevor doesnt buy into Dianas myth story but plays along to get back to the war They sail by boat back to LondonOne of the best sequences is Dianas introduction to early 20th century society Gadot offers an excellent performance as the slightly cultureshocked fishoutofwater but never overplays it She tries on a pouffe dress which definitely wouldnt be Wonder Woman Eventually she dons a suitable outfit and signs onto a mission with Trevor and several marginal characters to stop a fatal gas attack which makes the mustard gas of the war seem like the steam from a sauna The inventor is Doctor Isabel Maru aka Dr Poison who has been supported by General Ludendorff In fact Ludendorff was a real general in the First World War and was involved in Hitlers socalled Beer Hall Putsch to overthrow the German government in 1923 The mission is not sanctioned by the war office of London but in secret with only one member of Parliament offering assistance Sir Patrick Morgan David Thewlis This merry band of misfits a woman who knows nothing about western society and culture a Scottish drunk a Native American pacifist an Italian actor and an American spy make their way to the front lines of the First World WarAn outstanding film all around with excellent performances and a good balance between story and action The filmmakers made the decision to withhold Diana becoming Wonder Woman until nearly halfway into the film similar to Superman One of the best decisions she never says Im Wonder Woman A superhero speaking his or her name is a fatal screenplay error made by many other screenwriters who shall remain namelessWonder Woman is a superhero film starring Gal Gadot in the title role and the fourth installment in the DC Extended Universe Directed by Patty Jenkins 2003s Monster the film not only redeems the DC Universe of some of its previous missteps but also breathes some new life into the superhero franchise as a wholeIn 1918 the Amazonian princess Diana Gal Gadot trains with her fellow warrior sisters on the isolated island nation of Themyscira One day an American pilot named Steve Trevor Chris Pine crash lands near the island After being rescued by Diana Steve tells her and the other Amazonians of the outside world and of a war to end all wars currently being waged by the human race Refusing to allow the death and carnage to continue Diana decides to leave with Steve and fight alongside him to hopefully put a stop to the evil people responsible for this warFeaturing a well paced plot and some creatively choreographed action scenes Wonder Woman is exactly the type of movie that the DC Universe has needed for some time considering some of the poor creative decisions that were made in its three predecessors There was also a good balance of humour scattered throughout the story very much in the vein of some Marvel Cinematic Universe movies but never so much that it feels forced and tacked on at the last minute Gal Gadots performance in the eponymous role is great her acting range has improved significantly since Batman v Superman Dawn of Justice My only real complaint is that the film does follow a typical superhero origin story format and does little to detract from that However considering how interesting the main character is this does not draw away too much enjoyment from the overall filmI rate it 8510just back from my viewing this morning it is opened 305 here i n HK I admit i was having lot of doubts before getting to this movie First of all still no review yet on RT only few days before US opening  always a bad sign Few users reviews on the web and they seems to be too good to be REAL And yesterday i saw few users here saying those good reviews are fake and giving horrific 1 star and rant on the movie  will get back to this on the latter part my heart dropped dead Forgetting all those worries and trying to be neutral as best to see what i am going to get out from this film i could say i should never saw those evil brutal 1 star users what to say This movie is REALLY REALLY GOOD Those good reviews are no lie at all Everyone agrees wonder women was the highlight Of the BVS This movie elevates that into another level The story really give depth to the character Gal Gadot is really charming as the wonder women The action sequence was made beautifully and the final act was just WOW that it gave me a chill that i was longing for a superhero filmInevitably people do compare this to those Marvel works For me Wonder woman is on pal with Ironman 1  Captain America 2 winder solider And people have to bear in mind DC is always different from Marvel that is the reason it make this movie or DC movie so cool i do enjoy watching Marvel stuffs they are always entertaining and action packed but thats all they are kind of forgettable and lack of depth Except Ironman 1 CA2 or maybe civil war i dont really think other Marvels are really that great some are even not good to me ie Thor IM3 DC movie is not afraid of stepping into the dark side of the human heart it will give u something meaningful to ponder onWonderWomens backstory is set on the WW1 the darkest moment for the humanity it is the path for wonder women to realize who she really is and what she stands for out of knowing human is the one to blame for all the evil and terrible things they are capable of but human is also fond of love and capable of building better world The story is so compellingTo those people who could rate movie at 1 star i mean how could you do that just because you dont like it or simply you are fan of Marvel We really need different kind of movies more than just always one similar formulaI didnt remember how good this movie is This is a fine superhero origin story This is clearly inspired by Donners Superman and it has the charm of the first Raimis SpiderMan movie And Gal Gadot who would thought is the ultimate incarnation of Wonder Woman The first thing that will be in my mind if I hear or see about this character will be Gal Gadots face Patty Jenkins direction is amazing same thing with the photography Oh and Wonder Womans theme is badassAmazonian princess Diana Gal Gadot lives on the hidden island of Themyscira Queen Hippolyta Connie Nielsen forbids her training but Antiope Robin Wright disobeys her Zeus had created mankind which were corrupted by Ares God of War Zeus defeated him and hid Themyscira from the world One day Steve Trevor Chris Pine crashes his plane and is rescued by Diana Its WWI and Trevor is an American spy working for the British He had discovered that German General Ludendorff Danny Huston is developing a devastating new poison gas Diana fears that Ares has returned to wreck havoc and journeys to kill a God They travel to London where Sir Patrick David Thewlis is leading the peace effortThe DCEU was having problems I wouldnt say that it is in any danger but it needed an unreserved win This is exactly that I was leery of the choice of Gal Gadot when it was first announced Her English was barely understandable at the time and her acting was stiff Her English has improved by leaps and bounds and her acting is also better The genius of Patty Jenkins is to steer into her deficiencies Patty fully embraces her sincerity and makes all the Amazonians have the same accent as her Its a brilliant moveThe other Patty brilliance is her emotional IQ She understands human emotions better than anything in BvS The best comparison is Martha and the double reveal of Steves final conversation with Diana Martha is a silly construction The double scene is emotional heartbreak The action is solid The nomans land fight is amazing There is humor but not just the quippy Marvel humor It is characterbased and wellearned It hits almost every note perfectlyI got to see this at an early screening and I am extremely happy to announce that I love the movie Gal Gadot was the perfect cast for Wonder Woman The action sequences are amazing A great script and no editing problems like in Suicide Squad This is a very well made film Patty Jenkins did a fantastic job Chris Pine and Robin Wright are also really good Wonder Woman is inspiring and people will look up to her for decades because of this film The only flaw I have with this movie is the villain felt very much just like a generic throw away Marvel villainWow great story and acting from the top billed talent Gal Gadot and Chris Pine steal the show and make this thoroughly enjoying I was fortunate enough to see this in a nice theatre and this film was very impressive great effects nice soundtrack and great direction Personally I would have picked the second war to set this story to but that is my only complaint Great film go watch itFor the past 76 years Wonder Woman has been such an iconic female character in the DC universe She always proves that if men superheroes included can fight against the darkness the women can do it too With her sword shield and Lasso of Truth she fights for what she believes in and is always there to help those who are weak Now the time has come for Wonder Woman to make her way to the big screen for the first time ever and the results are phenomenal And if you remember Lynda Carter stepping into that costume and saving the day in the classic 70s show then you will definitely remember Isreali sweetheart Gal Gadot as the feisty tough and bighearted superheroine After her scenestealing debut performance as the Amazonian princess in the flawed but totally entertaining Batman V Superman Dawn of Justice I say its about time that a female superhero gets her chance to shine in her own film After a year in waiting for this movie to come out I can say this with a happy heart this movie is the ride that definitely lives up to the hype Deftly directed by Patty Jenkins who gave Charlize Theron an unforgettable performanceand an Oscaras the serial killer Aileen Wuornos in Monster Wonder Woman embraces its origin story with enough humor heart and stunningly choreographed action sequences that it never drags or sags it just comes alive in a real colorful way Born in the allfemale island of Themyscira Diana Gadot daughter of Queen Hippolyta Connie Nielsen has always wanted to be a warrior just like her mother and her aunt Antiope Robin Wright In the years that followed Diana has been training and preparing for action but discovers that she has powers that are astonishing Next thing we know a young soldier named Steve Trevor Chris Pine lands on the island and Diana is exposed to a more darker side of human nature where bullets are ripping out of their guns and lives are lost Steve manages to warn these ladies that war is coming the World War in fact with highly impossibly created weapons invented by Doctor Poison Elena Anaya and General Lundendorff Danny Huston So Diana leaves her paradise home and travels to London with Steve to fight and to find the one God that actually caused it I think you know what I am talking about Part of the fun and heart of this movie is watching Diana exploring and learning about the good and dark side of life As war causes pain casualties and emotions they can sometimes bring us hope that the world can change even if its not as better as one would expect Along the way Diana and Steve got the help they need in some unlikely characters including Steves smart assistant Etta Candy Lucy Davis a Scottish sharpshooter named Charlie Ewen Bremmer who is struggling with PTSD and a master of disguise named Sameer Said Taghmaoui as they fight their way into enemy territory with lots of surprises left in store for them After the superb Man of Steel and the flawed but somewhat good BVS and Suicide Squad Wonder Woman is the DC film Ive been waiting for Here is a rousing colorful and heartfelt adventure that has big laughs cool action characters that you can actually root for and a climax that may be as typical as one might expect from a superhero movie but its filled with more emotional power that some might not see coming The cast that Jenkins has managed to put together including the awesome David Thewlis in a pivotal role you have to witness for yourself is amazing Ive always been a fan of Chris Pines work following his best performances in the brilliant Hell or High Water and the Star Trek films The cocky demeanor that he brings to Captain Kirk is actually quite useful in the role of Steve Trevor and he has an real undeniable chemistry with Gadot Plus the screenplay by Allan Heinberg gives us dialogue that crackles with sly humor Most of the hearty laughs comes from Sameer Etta and of course Diana  Steve and a lot of exposition that creates a more streamlined plot that is more reserved for a film like this To end this review let me say something about Gal Gadot Its not easy to fill the shoes of Wonder Woman that was once inhabited by Lynda Carter But she makes it look effortless and puts a lot of hard work into the character She gives such a remarkable and endearing performance as Wonder Woman and I think this is the one that might actually make her a big star and the character that I cant wait to see again Shes wonderful So is the movieThe DC Universe gets a powerful boost with Patty Jenkins engaging thrilling modern tribute to the Wonder Woman legend The trailer did not do justice to this polished beautifully rendered film with an uncommon heart contrasting the increasingly tired smug Marvel tone The British supporting cast add a deeper flair to the proceedings with Lucy Davis and David Thewlis offering smart performances Gal Gadot channels a mixture of innocence strength wisdom and humour which reminded me of Christopher Reeve in Superman 1978 The script gives her performance a spirit and urgency which the origin story frame allows to flourish Chris Pine is equally fine balancing a challenging mixture of humility and bravado that gives the film a distinct edgeThe parallels with Superman 1978 are particularly apt Both films kickstarted modern takes on legendary figures with colourful exciting adaptations of origin stories The actions sequences are intense clever and filled with emotional resonanceI finally watched the new Wonder Woman movie I must say Im very impressed This has to be the best DC adaptation they have made in years The story was interesting and didnt feel cliche at all The action was all well choreographed and felt very organic I really love the character interaction in the film as well The film really brought to heart what Wonder Woman represented for DC Comics A great ride overall 9 out of 10It is visually stunning with a story that at times is baffling yet aptly comical not in a sense that its funny but true to a comic graphic novel originMany things dont make sense but here we have a superhero  superheroine who finds her way and stays true to her purposeAs usual I suspect the less you are familiar with Wonder Woman the comic book and TV series over the decades the more youll enjoy this adaptationI must be honest it took me a while before I finally decided to watch this as Im not a big Hollywood superhero movie fan Well I was pleasantly surprised Gil Gadot is excellent as Wonder Woman and lends credibility to the naive title character The chemistry between her and Chris Pine was wonderful and made for a very believable love story It felt very natural and romance between them seemed inevitableAs for the plot I enjoyed the way the Amazonian womens back story was told as well as Dianas Wonder Woman The visuals and photography are incredible This is a visual spectacle I loved the humorist dialogue which was genuinely funny and never over the top or slapstick Gil Gadot is just fabulousThis superhero movie had a very realistic feel to it with the added bonus of feeling and emotion There are so many truths in this film humanity should take note of The film has a very unexpected ending compared to most superhero movies and thats what I honestly loved about the filmWell Wonder Woman first movie for four very very very much I loved the movie Gal Gadot really plays a role in my opinion maybe the most important in the career of the movie is full of action and its just crazy onight there is no night with wow such a crazy plot but buana it really I Disney and Marvel I more like the friendly battles and especially the Wonder Woman characters it is in my opinion among the best Disney movies that have been and I very much hope that Disney is something like this a very very good movieIve loved Wonder Woman for a long time and after a rewatch I can certainly say it was just as good as the first time and currently one of my favorite DC movies Ive never really been drawn to Wonder Woman as a character but this movie made me a lot more interested in the character Gal Gadot owned the role as Wonder Woman and reminded me of Christopher Reeve in the first Superman movie both fantastic casting choicesThroughout the whole 142 minutes it grounds Wonder Woman and puts her in an interesting setting and takes her in dark directions the action sequences were terrific and the villain was scary with an awesome finale and gorgeous cinematography Chris Pine wasnt the best in the film and that definitely knocked it down a few notches but I still think its greatIm gonna give Wonder Woman an AIf there was one thought to streak across my mind throughout the entire runtime of director Patty Jenkins longawaited cinematic adaptation of the iconic comicbook character Wonder Woman its a simple word redemption This is the first film in DCs struggling Extended Universe to live up to the promise of its comicbook origins There have been hints at brilliance here and there but the three previously released films have all ultimately faltered and fallen flat due to their own numerous issues and contrivances and infuriating focus on convoluted style over substance Not so with Wonder Woman this is the first film in the entire series that places all of its focus on delivering a charming thrilling and entertaining film foremost where the style is dictated by the story and not the other way aroundIf youve grown tired of waiting for the next great DC cinematic adventure If like me and many others previous releases like Batman V Superman and Suicide Squad left you feeling empty and angry and underwhelmed If you were worried that the DCEU would just be a constant exercise in misery and tedium your hopes for something better something good have been fulfilled with the absolutely delightful Wonder Woman Its not a perfect film mind you Its uneven at times and suffers the same onedimensional villains that have plagued the similar Marvel Cinematic Universe But it is a promise of better things to come in the future and is not only by and far the best the DCEU has to offer at this point its just a darned good film in its own rightOn the island of Themyscira Diana Gal Gadot lives in peace princess of a tribe of Amazon warriors created by the great Greek Gods to protect humanity from the clutches of Ares God of War However the human world soon enough intrudes on Dianas idyllic life when American Spy Steve Trevor Chris Pine crashlands near her home and she and the other Amazon warriors are told of the Great War that is taking place World War I Diana goes against her mothers wishes and leaves the island with Steve hoping that in helping him on his mission to stop a deadly chemical attack by the German army she will be able to confront Ares and put an end to all war But at what cost will her daring mission comeThe great success of Wonder Woman comes in large part from its simplicity and keen storytelling It doesnt venture into needlessly lofty and overstuffed and halfbaked themes and sequelbaiting as has been the case with previous installments of the DC franchise but instead just tries its hardest to be a competent concise and entertaining origin story And thats why it succeeds Director Jenkins and screenwriter Allan Heinberg smartly concentrate on the fundamentals of character establishment and development above all else while also giving the film a great deal more personality than has been evident in previous films With razorsharp writing topnotch action set pieces and a constant and appropriate sense of humor that keeps the chuckles coming youd be hard pressed not to find yourself grinning earto ear throughout the entire film The cast is also just a ton of fun Gadot was by and far the best element in the otherwise sloppy Batman V Superman but she wasnt given much to do Here she absolutely shines and proves herself more than worthy to call herself Wonder Woman Shes got the dramatic chops to handle the heavier moments the lighthearted whimsy to perfectly land the films many delightful fish out of water gags and she just kicks major butt I cant wait to see her again on the bigscreen I also quite enjoyed Pine in his supporting role Its a bit of a standard character but he gives it the same wonderful personality hes injected to so many other roles And supporting parts played by the likes of Robin Wright Connie Nielsen and Sa√Ød Taghmaoui are all exceptionally wellcast and performedThis praise all being said the film does have some rather large issues that I feel are being generally overlooked Especially with the film being as hyped up and overpoliticized as it has been Funnily enough the film suffers a major issue that also desperately plagues many films of their rival studio Marvel the villains are weak Pathetic even Despite having the delightful duo of Danny Huston and Elena Anaya portraying them the villainous Erich Ludendorff and Doctor Poison are frankly laughable at times coming off as so stock as to be ridiculous At times they even feel like theyre in a completely different and far inferior film I know I cant be the only one to cringe when they repeatedly use the old trope of villain kills an associate to show hes a threat several times to increasingly hilarious results In addition the film is a bit uneven as it reaches its midway point with several key characters from the first act seemingly vanishing and some plotthreads being abandoned for prolonged periods of time Its a bit distracting You know the film is capable of so much moreBut despite these complaints I cant help but wholeheartedly recommend Wonder Woman Its just such a breath of fresh air for this particular franchise thanks to its smart filmmaking and fantastic performances I was worried before the film came out Because I will fully admit I have not enjoyed a single other film in the DC Extended Universe to this point and I was fearing that Wonder Woman would deal one last fatal blow to the franchise But it did just the opposite it revitalized it in the best of ways And I would favorably compare it to other great superhero origins of the past 10 years and say its one of my favorite Summer action films of 2017 thus farWonder Woman gets a very good 8 out of 10Theres a lot that went into Wonder Woman its partially a romantic comedy comingofage story period actionsuperhero movie but maybe above all a love story Diana Prince gears up ultimately out of love  which doesnt sound like something thatd fit very well in a war movie Part of the reason this movie is so good is that it had big boots to fill The DC movies havent been stellar up to this point and their inherent dreariness hasnt helped matters And heres a movie with competent direction gorgeous visuals and a lead actress thats fully up to the challenge Gal Gadot instills in her character honor innocence and the necessary color to really bring a comic book movie to the screenIn other words its everything I was hoping for in a Wonder Woman film It doesnt feel like it was ground out of a sausage factory and really manages to do everything right Just to give context this is coming from a guy whos pretty burnt out on the genre I loved this movie810Not me of course though I do admit I was wondering if this was going to be any good DC did not have the best record concerning building up their universe so skepticism was not really out of the ordinary But the movie proved me wrong and made a lot of things right And its really nice that its the Wonder Woman movie to kick off that trend I know some will either cherish that and others will hate it  just try to leave the feminism discussion out of itAnd enjoy a movie that really captures the making of a superhero Wonder Woman rising in the best sense There still are some hurdles that are tough to overcome The main villain for example has his issues but for every thing that may not work 100 you have twice or three times as many other things that are really good Take Chris Pine for example I wasnt sure if this was necessary casting  but it very much was You needed someone who could hold his own And Gal Gadot really is amazing in this Looks and beauty aside she really pulled her weight acting wiseThis review of Wonder Woman is spoiler free 45THERES A SAYING a metaphor perhaps that states if a series or a distributor starts with a few false starts in previous instalments then the hype for the next instalment will dwindle this of course is true for other series of films but for the DCEU it clearly isnt There have been a few false starts for the series Man of Steel didnt live to expectation nor Batman Vs Superman Dawn of Justice wasnt as good as was previously thought then Suicide Squad fell into the world of shame rather than live up to what it said on the tin It seem the DCEU was in need of a saviour at first this saviour came from a meme ‚Äì this had a bruised Batman and tired Superman fighting in an endless war then beyond that shadow stands Gal Gadots Diana ‚Äì perhaps the saviour of BvS After Patty Jenkins Wonder Woman the metaphor loses its sight and goes into turmoil in the opening few minutes theres colour a narration that explains the comings of war between gods and humans and a young Diana Prince exceptional work from youngster Lilly Aspell willing to train for a coming war Her mother Robin Wright explains that there is no need to do this ‚Äì after this the origin of the princess progresses to when she is all grown up and has become a trained warrior The opening origin story is exceptional theres a lot colour which we havent seen in previous instalments theres stunning story narration and a wonderful shot of Gadots Diana training with her auntie Connie Nielsen the best fighter on the island An island inhabited by women until a manly presence invades their homeland enter American spy Captain Steve Trevor Chris Pine he speaks of an ongoing war in the outer world When hes teamed with Gadot their chemistry is magnificent these two work well together and prove to be the dynamic that we need Pine is exceptional as Steve hes funny hes handsome and hes a charmer who does anything to please our heroine Diana whos never seen a man before is wonderful to behold especially when she tells Steve about where she comes from She wants to go with him to go fight the ongoing war ‚Äì meanwhile villainous doctor Dr Poison Elana Anaya and her warmongering companion Ludendorff Danny Huston design dangerous weapons to outfit their soldiers Its a wonderful story of war and super heroism a mach that never made a keen pairing before but nowadays it works Its dark but constantly dark and brooding as the previous films something that the earlier DCEU intended to rely on Wonder Woman proves that you dont need to be dark to be good And she does her job well as Diana Gadot is fantastic shes a beautiful princess who loves the world of men and believes that life has a meaning as her stronger alter ego shes exceptional shes strong but on the inside shes vulnerable unlike the caped crusaders or the men of steel shes not afraid to show emotion and the other wonder woman helming her director Jenkins shows this with exquisite style Diana was the saviour in BvS here she proves to be the saviour again who takes no BS And Jenkins proves that a DC movie can have style too ‚Äì she adds a lot of elements here that makes this superhuman feel more human as said she adds emotion there are other elements too the vulnerability makes her a more connectable superhero it proves strength in the female superhero line Sadly its not wonderful in the last 20 minutes it hits a clich√© cg barrier that other superhero movies seem to rely on nowadays there are some moments that look theyre made from green screen and sadly doesnt make it as good as it couldve been Other than that everything here delivers exceptionally well Jenkins proves that could teach the caped crusaders or men of steel a thing or two with this instalment its shes brought new light to the DCEU and its about damn timeVERDICT After a few false starts to the DCEU it finally has a success in fantastic style that hits punches with brilliant execution and fabulous performances this is perhaps the best instalment to the DCEU ever now we can breathe againOverall taken at face value Wonder Woman is better than the average superhero film on a few levelsThis was refreshing to watch simply because nothing in it felt like they were trying too hard The movie flowed smoothly from start to finish and the ending was if overdramatic definitely the payoff you were waiting forIts a fun popcorn flick that has the ability to make any little girl watching it feel empoweredi did like this movie i was entertained and i liked certain aspects of it for sure is it a good movie yes it is is it a great movie no it isnt though the high rotten tomatoes rating suggests its a masterpiece it is far from that sadly i think it had the potential to be great but due to the lack of continuity this movie had it struggled to reach its full potential it is the best DCU movie by far but honestly thats really not saying much wonder woman is a let down on all parts which is a real shame this shows that justice league will probably be no betterIt really is amazing how long it took for Wonder Woman to have a movie It is a simple story WW goes to the mans world and tries to find and kill Ares in WWI It shows the origin of WW very well It has very good action scenes excepting the ending and a good development of characters People actually made more of this movie than it actually was its just good and thats allHi Ive never written a review here before but I love this movie so much I had to do it Realistically I would have given it an 8 or 9 because I know its not perfect There are cracks in this movie and they show But to me a 1010 isnt a perfect movie Its one that is not only well made but also so impressive and so emotionally affecting that it makes the flaws irrelevant I LOVE this movie Its acting its direction its effects its story and dialogue everything And in this case it made me feel amazing It reached inside of me and made my heart feel warm and strong Thats what this movie  this fun and smart and exciting and captivating depiction of the Wonder Woman character  did to me Please see this movieThe much anticipated new Wonder Woman movie is with us and for once the film lives up to the walltowall marketing hypeWith a heavy dose of mythology Diana is growing up as the cossetted daughter of Hippolyta Connie Nielsen Gladiator the Queen of the Amazons on the hidden paradise island of Themyscira Trained up as a warrior by Hippolytas sister General Antiope Robin Wright of House of Cards Diana is clearly something special Her ego is reinforced by the knowledge that she was made of clay with life breathed into her by the God Zeus ¬†Its enough to turn a girls headIts 1917 and the manfree paradise is shaken up when an American spy by the name of Steve Trevor Chris Pine Star Trek Beyond crash lands in the waters off Themyscira ¬†And yes you didnt mishear me this film genuinely features a hero with both the names Steve and Trevor Prince Eric  no sorry wrong film  is saved and awakened on the beach by Diana as the others arrive ¬†Thank God say the Amazonians At last someone to process the 200 year backlog of washing and ironing ¬†But Steve an above average specimen LOL is not long for paradise as he needs to return to the war with the results of his spywork a chemistry book stolen from the gorgeously deformed Dr Maru Elena Anaya gasdeveloper for the evil General Ludendorff¬†Danny Huston Seeing Ludendorff to be her Godlike nemesis Ares Diana returns with Steve to the WW1 battlefields with the intent of killing the God of War and so ending the war to end all warsMuch fish out of water fun is had with Diana meeting civilised London society although perhaps this section of the film doesnt quite live up to its full potential ¬†having ice cream for the first time without any sign of surprise all she can come up with is an amusing but rather lame You must be very proudBut where the film really accelerates into awesomeness is when Diana reaches the trenches She emerges from the trenches like some shimmering vision of hotness to set male and lesbian hearts a flutter Its the most memorable trenchexit since the finale of Black Adder 4 and the subsequent scenes of Diana singlehandedly facing the German guns is for me one of the most compelling and enjoyable scenes in any recent DC or Marvel movieHolding all this together is the exIsraeli armytrainer Gal Gadot in the title role And man oh man what a Gal Statuesque athletic but also sweet charming and emotionally fragile she completely owns this role from beginning to end ¬†Gadot made a memorable entry in the otherwise poor Batman v Superman Dawn of Justice marthagate neverforget neverforgive but nothing prepares you for just how great she is in this outing Chris Pine  the thinking womens Chris Pratt  once again proves himself as a talented actor who manages to successfully morph to inhabit the role he plays Much as he did in the excellent Hell or High Water not once did I equate him to be James Tiberius Kirk after the first 5 minutes¬†Effective in supporting roles are David Thewlis Harry Potter as a helpful army bod and an almost unrecognisable Lucy Davis The Office as Etta Steves comedic secretary ¬†Steves rather unlikely sidekicks of Sameer Said Taghmaoui American Hustle Charlie Ewen Bremner Trainspotting and The Chief Eugene Brave Rock The Revenant all rather fade into the woodwork by comparison¬†I saw the film in 3D careful now you could take an eye out with those things and very good it was too Aside from some rather unnecessary Amazonian arrows its never feels overdone and elements of it were extremely effectiveAnother star of the show is the superb Wonder Woman theme by Hans Zimmer here rolled out by the films composer Rupert GregsonWilliams Hacksaw Ridge Unfortunately the rest of the soundtrack is not particularly memorableThe film shifts into more traditional yawnworthy superhero finale mode in the last twenty minutes which is a bit of a shame Patty Jenkins Monster directs and knows the audience she is aiming to please One can only imagine the empowering impact this film will have on young girls crossing their wrists and in their imagination casting terrorists into the hell that they should be consigned to In this week of yet more Isis atrocity in London Wonder Woman is a role model we could all stand and salute I believe in love tooThis is an abridged version of the One Manns Movies graphical review Please visit bobthemoviemancom ThanksWow Let me just get this out of the way I love both Marvel and DC I want them all to be good but if Im being honest Batman v Superman and Suicide Squad are complete misfires Theyre both messy mishandled with a lot of corporate meddling However Wonder Woman is the complete opposite This marks a second great DC film for WB in my booksI know there are people who lovehate Man of Steel but I happened to really like it Princess Diana otherwise known as Wonder Woman here is fully realized and completely threedimensional She finally gets her due in cinema and I cannot be more pleased Shes idealistic yet naive compassionate yet stubborn and brave I typically dislike origin stories but every now and then they can be very fun and Wonder Woman is that exception Patty Jenkins who led Charlize Theron to an Oscar brings a story that is packed with heart without ever getting too over the top or too heavy handed During the hype train I disliked the idea of Gal Gadot mainly due to her inexperience as an actor She slightly won me over for the short amount of time she was in Batman v Superman but now she really won me over I will admit there are moments where she didnt exactly deliver her lines effectively but I think the more she plays this character the more better shell be Chris Pine is great in the role of Steve Trevor Again while I thought some of Gadots delivery felt dry or cheesy she and Pine do have a great chemistry I always preach about this and even if it sounds like overkill at this point but chemistry is so important with anything that has to do with romance The romance here is solid and believable In a very good way it was very reminiscent of Steve Rogers and Peggy Carter The supporting cast are solid highlights include Connie Nielsen and Robin Wright portray Queen Hippolyta and General Antiope and theyre not characters who get the short end of the stick they actually contribute to Dianas upbringing The supporting cast is good too Pines Trevor recruits a ragtag team again reminiscent of The Howling Commandos in Captain America The First Avenger Taking a page off Marvel though the villains are the ones who do end up getting the short end of the stick There is a twist I didnt see coming but even then it was a bit excessive and kind of out of place I will say though I happened to enjoy only Elena Anayas creepy Doctor Poison out of the films villains The third act is slightly underwhelming but the action scenes are fantastic I was quite surprised as I was concerned about Patty Jenkins ability to shoot action Also theyre lit in daylight and being able to see everything unfold is just pure eyecandy Something I appreciated is that Jenkins also shows the casualty of what war brings and she doesnt compromise on the gruesome reality of it Visual effects are good but there are few moments where its so obvious that its cgi Im not very picky in that department but when its too too noticeable then it automatically takes me out of the filmI did mention Captain America The First Avenger multiple times and the film takes some influences and operates like it but its not a carbon copy at all On the surface Wonder Woman might appear to be of similar adventures and superhero films that weve seen on screen but its moving parts and the little things it does that makes the film shine With good character moments humorous banter and a resonating romance it is the female superhero film that we needed 8510A WWI battlefield shrouded in gun smoke and war remains is flanked by trenches of soldiers whove accepted their fate of spending the rest of their short lives in this hell On one end a powerful but na√Øve woman slowly emerges armed with a shield a sword and a bundle of conviction to put an end to all of it In this one suretobe iconic moment the world is reintroduced to its new favorite superhero Wonder Woman an unabashed womanempowerment film uses its preestablished muscle for good to give us a blockbuster full of true excitement true humor and true heart Being a wartimesuperhero film we expect a certain quality of action and this delivers the beach attack on the island full of Amazon women is a slowmotion blast of flying and fighting But what really soars is the script filled with dialogue that surprisingly pops We cant fix the war but we can try to get to the men who can I AM the men who can Elements of fishoutofwater believable romance and confident humor are more than consistent enough to the small moments of predictability corn and bad visual effects I cant help but imagine what if this was our introduction to the Justice League universe Instead of the fauxcomplexity of the Superman entries or the offensive simplicity of Suicide Squad wed be setting the tone for the franchise with a film about the effects of violence the insanity of war and whether humans are inherently good or evil Either way its so great to report that DC has more than righted their course and made a genre film for the agesWell I think this was a rather different type of DC superheroes movies This one was felt as a combination of fun and a little bit dark altogether This movie was telling the origin of Wonder Woman and I think it was told in a very nice way The earlier part showing Diana since her childhood was quite nice to see What I loved the most was actually the moment when Diana went to London for the very first time It was truly fun to see the naivety of her in the mans world and I think Gal Gadots portrayal in these scenes were very spot onWhat I loved about this movie was also the way Diana evolved from the innocent Amazon woman to what she became at the end I believe the duration of the movie was just nice even though it was a little bit over than 2 hours Some might feel it was too long at the beginning but it should not be considered as a flaw My wife and I really enjoyed this movie I know she was touched during those emotional moments and I know she loved Gal Gadot portraying Wonder WomanChris Pine was charming as Steve Rogers and his chemistry with Gal Gadot seemed very nice The awkward moments during their trip back to London were very fun to see as well Steves allies particularly Sameer was the stand out one Apart from the fun part there were also some dark moments and emotional moments as well reminding us that DC superhero adaptation movies would always have dark tone but it was not as dark as the other earlier movies Those of you who prefer lighter tone would definitely be able to enjoy thisThis movie was directed by Patty Jenkins who had just 1 movie to her credit prior to this one albeit a very highly critically acclaimed one titled Monster with its main cast Charlize Theron won the Golden Globe and Academy Awards It was a surprise to me that she was able to make the action sequence looked very cool The special effects was wonderful The fight scenes were nice The sound effects were great especially since I saw this in a theater with Dolby Atmos sound system The dramatic emotional fun scenes were nicely done by Jenkins All around I think she did a wonderful job directing this movie and hopefully it would bring more audiences to flock the theatersFor those who are expecting to see postcredit scene be informed that this one did not have any just like in Batman VS Superman Dawn of Justice I guess they did not really want to be seen just like any other Marvel movies Although there was some brief midcredit scene in Suicide Squad In conclusion I believe this one was a wonderful superhero movie from DC comics Not since Elektra in 2005 that a female superhero became the lead of a movie based on comic books Not even Marvel had it in the Marvel cinematic universe Perhaps after this they would be making an independent movie of Black Widow Anyway for those of you who prefer Marvel comics movies compared to DC comics movies due to their lighter tones I think this one would surprise you For those who are die hard fans of DC comics I am sure you would be coming to see this one anyway But for those who just enjoy the movies adapted from any comic books you should be able to enjoy this one Just watch this and you would understand what I meantFor my complete review pls have a look at michaelnontonmulublogspotcoidSeeing this again man or woman I want to rate this even higher for the parts I like even for the opening on Themyscyra sic because I bought in even more to the emotion of how it was played so straight by the actors and staged by Jenkins Gal Gadot is the new Christopher Reeve and in her own way even more badass because of how much she makes Diana a force to be reckoned with while keeping so much vulnerability just under the surface She and Chris Pine are a wonderful 30s or 40s rom com couple though more adorable due to Dianas mix of awkwardness and strength often in the same breath But that climax is still not impressive on a technical level I dont even mean how the conflict has to come to a head I get all of that and I even liked the I BELIEVE IN A THING CALLED LOVE cue guitar lick moment because Jenkins is not only not afraid of cheese she doesnt know what the word means but it connects with the key theme of the movie I know so many of the final battle scenes or fights that happen with these comic book movies have been called bullshit but a there were less than zero stakes because Spoiler we know Wonder Woman doesnt succumb to evil because of her appearance in the previous DC movie that takes place 100 years after this one and I so wish it didnt exist due to the continuity errors it places with this and b the CGI is laughable with David Thewlis who you ALL owe it to yourselves to see on Fargo s3 not being good at turning total evil HAMSo in short the parts I liked before I liked a little or a lot more the No Mans Land is the one part mostly when Diana first appears that just iconographywise is cool and the parts I didnt I felt so so so embarrassed Hence this review and half a star bump Its also the best DC comic book movie since Batman Begins So thereIt goes without saying that dark comedy is very difficult to accomplish I would almost say its harder to pull off than regular comedy because you need to be able to keep people invested in the dramatic aspect of the film while still keeping them laughing throughout the majority of the duration Director Martin McDonagh has matured as a filmmaker over the years starting off with In Bruges which was pretty much a flatout comedy to Seven Psychopaths which placed him a little further into the spotlight but I must admit that Three Billboards Outside Ebbing Missouri is not only his best film to date but also one of the best films Ive received the pleasure of witnessing all year From laughter to genuine tension and heart this is a film thats pretty much perfect all around Here is why I can recommend this film to everyoneAfter the tragic death of her daughter Mildred Hayes calls out the local authorities on three billboards publicly stating that theyre not doing their jobs and not a single arrest has happened since the death of her daughter While publicly displaying this is upsetting to some she sees it as a point being made Through some very cleverly written humor throughout the entire film levity is brought to the table in times of sorrow making this a very easy movie to watch Although the story itself is quite depressing this film is written in a way that will still find a way to make you smileI was pleasantly surprised with this movie and liked it They did well by delving into the legend although playing loosely with some mythology Still the movie was entertaining and Gadot effective After hating Batman vs Superman this was a relief I hope DCs future offerings will be more like this and less like some of the weaker ones One weakness of this movie was where they treated the WWI Germans as if they were Nazis Great historical weakness there as there were huge differences between the First and Second World WarsWhat were Warner Bros and DC comics smoking when they decided to make Batman vs Superman and Suicide Squad Or what were they smoking when they decided to release Wonder Woman WW before Justice LeagueWhatever they were smoking the latter was the better stuff because the only word I can think off describing this movie is fantastic  Yup The previous two releases with huge star casts and big budget action sequences were to be told in truth plain boring WW is like the monsoon in India refreshing and entertainingTo be frank there is nothing new in WW if you scratch the surface It is the coming of age of person who has superpowers and fights a villain to protect the world a sample template of all superhero filmsBut WW is different because the superhero is a woman and that where Patty Jenkins and the writers catch our attention and surprise us When was the last time we saw a movie completely dedicated to woman superhero They get most of things perfect from the word go Amazons the place where WW is born and belongs to is visually mind blowing and beautiful The warrior women star cast is perfect with Nelson and Wright perfectly playing Dianas mother and aunt Special mention to Wright who is terrific in action sequences inspite of her ageAnd then comes Chris Pine who is so happy to play second fiddle to WW He is the catalyst and the wow factor for women audience He and WW share a fabulous chemistry on screen and have some nice comic moments tooThe movie takes time to build up and the setting of WW One is prefect And there is that one beautiful action set piece with WW taking on the Germans on the battlefield and single handedly destroying them PerfectAnd finally there is Gal Gadot aka WW aka Diana Gadot seems to have been born to play WW She has the physique the personality and the acting skills to play this role I dont think any other actor would have done justice to this part She is breath taking in the action sequences and what we saw of her in Batman vs Superman was just a trailer She owns this roleThe action sequences are good and the technically its a pretty neat filmHowever the climax was tad disappointing and the villain was big let down Thewlis is fine actor but not suited to play the villain Plus the villains role was poorly written Even Dr Marus role was not well written and I hope to see more of her sometime in the futureBut its still a great film and a must watch for movie buffs If you are a woman you will love it as its all about women empowerment For men watching Gadot in short skirts beating the hell out of the bad guys is fulfilling Cant wait for the sequel he he heWonder Woman is great When the first trailer was released I was quite pumped already Ive always liked Wonder Woman and it was great to finally see her in the silver screen with todays effects and allWonder Woman is a great hero Shes strong intuitive and tough while still being both compassionate and kind which was essential to her original character and this movie keeps true to that Diana in this movie has those same characters and Gal Dadots performance was very believableThe movie is essentially an origin story which can be hit or miss The DC Extended Universe movies have not been well received at all but more on this later The movies color scheme is quite clever showing the island Diana grew up on as a very bright and beautiful with everything outside of it being dark and dreary It captures the intensity and grit of war especially the time it takes place in World War I Theres even a scene where they go into the trenches and its quite authentic There isnt a single filler character even the side characters of the group of soldiers she links up with are entertaining and add a lot of flavor to the movie My only nitpick is that the music seemed all over the placeThis is also a great return for DC movies As I mentioned before recent DC movies such as Man of Steel Batman V Superman and Suicide Squad a movie I actually liked for just how fun it was werent greatly reciprocated and for good reasons But Wonder Woman nails everything that DC movies in the past were great balancing comedy and intensity The movie doesnt have that many comedic moments towards the end but it does have that balance very well in the beginning and the movie benefits because of itIn the end I highly recommend this film I feel that its one most people should enjoy especially those who have been disappointed by DC movies over the past couple of moviesIn DCs new installation director Patty Jenkins and co breathe new life into the 75yearold iconic character Created for the purpose of fighting using love Wonder Woman had always been a interesting character to include in stories but hard to pinpoint when it came to personality After the last 3 DC movies I said no more for me Im glad a friend changed my mind on that I didnt go to see it because it was the next chapter in a cinematic universe I saw it because it told a story and the hype behind all the critic reviews of course And theres a perfect balance to her shes not sexual used by virtue of her appearance and shes not a feminist Shes just a woman who shows vulnerability and wants there to be world peace I was so surprised by how much they humanized her Inspite of the fact that she was a stonehard killer she looked at the world mostly through the eyes of a little girl And I never expected that I didnt just like it because it was a great movie I also liked it because this is the best incarnation of Wonder Woman Ive ever seen even compared to the animated features If you want a movie with great world history a little bit of mythology and an awesome new superhero the center of it all Id recommend checking this one out This took decades to get to and even Joss Whedon admitted it was too complicated for him to make Dont watch this because of the Cinematic Universe watch it because its a good movie with finally a wellmade message behind itI enjoy this movie when start to the end this movie make me excite fill love and cryFrom all the superhero films this was one of the most anticipated Mainly because of the woman oriented theme People were desperate to see the solo woman superhero Today we have the great visual effects technology that anything can be possible to bring on to the screen And actress like Gal Gadot even better it gets Yes it was a wonderful film A simple storyline but a well made filmThe Amazonians who are cut off from the rest of the world is preparing for the battle if Ares returns All these years nothing has happened but one day a fighter pilot crash on the cost of their island Then the princess embark a journey back with him to find and end the Ares threat forever But she only ends up in the WWII and what happens in the following sequence are the rest of the filmWho would have done a better job than Patty Jenkins She nailed it and so set to direct the sequel too Even the supporting cast was good DCs visuals always high standards and so this one Action sequences too amazing Theres lots of changes in the character as well as in everything Firstly a nice superhero costume And connections like Dianas father the island all pretty nicely written out The DC universe just got extended I cant wait to see Justice League810Gal Gadot and Chris Pine both give a fantastic performance in this superhero film the story was relatively original given how much of a generic formula most of this action hero genre follows the character development was unique and special the story was nice and heartfelt but had some weak moments that werent necessary and made the film longer than it needed to be between this and The Dark Knight DC has been keeping its legacy in modern cinema going strongReading the reviews here Either they are bowing down to the movie or just hating blindly Not sure how many have actually seen it Very good movie after all the disappointment from the past DCEU moviesSeeing all the trailers and featurettes very little was left for imagination but those didnt disappoint The movie is about the journey of a demigod from Themyscira where its all bright and shiny to the real world which is torn by war greed hatred and darkness Diana walks in as the lightGetting her influence from Donner Patty Jenkins got it right What it means to be a hero what does it mean to inspireand the quest for the Amazon beauty to become the light in the darkness Strength sorrow motivation humanity hope and loss forges the path to be the ultimate hero shes meant to beGal Gadot surprised me Most of her past performances were well sub par Finally shes in the spotlight She did pretty well Although she has a long way to go everyone begins somewhere This movie is for her Kudos for her strong performance specially the fight sequencesWe all deserved this movie While not a masterpiece but good enough to be the stepping stone for women empowerment and a proper story for a demigod and one of the most popular female superhero who can go toe to toe with the all powerful Superman I just cant wait to see her interactions and chemistry with the big blue and how they co ordinate being the two gods that they are DCEU is back on trackApart from her Chris Pine as Steve Trevor shined and he is straight from the comic book pages Hes a good actor not surprisingDespite all the positives it has its flaws Some scenes were too long and unnecessarily dragged Dianas chemistry with Steve could have been better Dr Poison was equivalent to Kaecilius henchmenwastedA good ending satisfies all after the emotional turbulence audiences go through This movie did justice to thatThat being said Man of Steel still remains the favorite DCEU movie for me But perhaps thats because Im biased to Supes710Wonder woman starts with showing where wonder woman aka Diana Prince came from the amazons who live on the island Themyscira The island is somewhere near Greece but hidden from view by a strange fog for normal people We follow how Diana grows up to become one of the greatest amazon to have ever lived On the day of her final training something strange happens a German plane from the first world war breaks through the fog surrounding Themyscira and crashes into the sea Diana rescues the man Steve a British spy played by Chris Pine inside the plane but he is pursued by German soldiers who also break through the fog The Germans are quickly defeated by the mighty amazon warriors and learn from Steve that the whole world is currently fighting a great war Diana thinks it must be the work of Ares the god of war and that it is time to wield the god killer sword to put an end to Ares once and for all Together with Steve and his friends she leaves the island of Themyscira to go to horrific front of the first world war trying to find and defeat Aris I went into this movie a bit skeptical because I wasnt impressed by Batman VS Superman where the modern version Wonder Woman made her entrance But the character is interesting so I was curious how her origin story panned out The start of the movie was a bit to serioushigh fantasy for me but once Chris Pine enters the picture it gets a lot lighter in tone and I started to like it a lot more I really like Pine in The scenes where Diana enters London and gets in contact with 1910s civilization are hilarious and Gal Gadot does a fine job playing someone whos from a different world I also liked the supporting cast who play Steves friends lots of humor in those scenes The action scenes where mostly very well done Cool slow motion effects and very good stunt work My only gripe was that the CGI doubles of wonder woman and her opponents where a bit to obvious in a few scenes And like in many comic book movies this movie also suffered from a bad guy that was not impressive at all The final confrontation was a bit to predictable and way to much CGI effects for my taste But there was an emotional touch in the ending which was well done and unexpected Wonder woman is an enjoyable action movie with great action scenes and some good laughs Recommended if your in for an entertaining action movie with some fantasy elementsDC has finally set their foot in the right direction Say what you want about the previous films but I think we can all agree that they werent as well received as they could have been Now with Wonder Woman we have a good solid superhero story thats actually meaningful Zack Snyder is not directing this time around but his influence is still felt in the visual style of the explosive action scenes Those parts are very entertaining but they dont take center stage here This film takes the time to introduce us to characters we can understand and care for I think Patty Jenkins handled the emotional story nicely I enjoyed the quite scenes as much as the exciting ones Its about this one journey which makes it easy to follow So its not a very complicated filmThe scenery on the Amazonian island is breathtaking Perfect use of locations The ancient Greek mythology elements work surprisingly well The idea of setting the world outside the Amazonian realm during WWI is good It makes the fish out of water situation with Diana even more interesting and above all it really helped her development So that made sense I will say this though If you are well educated in history and you happen to know a lot about WWI then you are gonna be annoyed by some things here Because it doesnt stay completely true to how everything was back then Some liberties were taken here and there Im not an expert on war history but my brother is and I had to listen to many things that were inaccurate on the way home after the screening So sure They should have gotten some more history consultants to revise the production As a normal movie goer you probably wont even think about those things But if you are a history buff then take note that this is pure fantasyescapism You wont be too bothered about historical inaccuracies if you go in with that mindset I do think the villains were very stereotypical Most of the time it works but I would have preferred them not being so much like cartoon bad guys The final fight gets really bloated and CGI heavy with many explosions Its handled much better then how it was in Batman v Superman and Ill tell you why It was focused The entire movie balances the human story with the action spectacle well And that gets a good positive point from meThe main characters are likable here Theres not much I can add to whats already been said but I strongly believe Im seeing Wonder Woman on screen and not the actress Gal Gadot She embodies this role with pride Her chemistry with Chris Pine is great Theres some banter towards the end that gets repetitive but other than that I liked it The movie has a nice message as well Its about working together and that love and compassion should never be forgotten All of those things are nice This movie has an upbeat vibe overall Its kind of like a classic adventure movie and I like that You will walk out feeling happy or maybe even a little inspired Thats a good sign that this will not be forgotten anytime soon So yes I can now say that this a wonderful step forwards for DC They have definitely improved a lot and I hope they continue like thisGal Gadot did an amazing job as Wonder Woman The film was a little slow paced at times and left confusing messages over the power of the Amazonians  when you see the ending and how Wonder Womans true powers are sparked The leading man in the film was a bit of a meh performance someone else could have played the part with a little less spunk and a little more complimenting presence Good solid but not amazingSoild film much better then the MCU film about captain marvel recommending to every one who loves DCEU and a good filmHere is my spoilerfree review of Wonder Woman After three films that left most people disappointed or upset Wonder Woman had a very difficult job to do It had to please the fans make people believe in the DCEU again and of course be a good movie I personally really like Man of Steel and the directors cut of Batman V Superman i am not going to talk about suicide squad so i was very excited about watching Wonder Woman and i Think it delivered It was entertaining at all times it had exciting action setpieces but it still took its time to have some more quite character moments between Chris Pine and Gal Gadot This is what makes this movie special It told a great origin story with some themes that were very fitting to the rest of the film I still have a few issues with the film like the Way some of the characters were treated and the use of CGI explosions but thats about it Wonder Woman is a great summer blockbuster with story courage and a lot of heart Absolutely a film that you should watch even If you are not familiar with the comics 810 ‚≠êÔ∏èRousing movie with full of action and amusement  its complemented by exciting images  thrills and breathtaking scenes  including groundbreaking

scenes  dazzling production design and stateofart special effects  This spectacular comicbook movie contains fantasy  noisy action  battles romance  and is pretty entertaining This is a dynamic  fast paced and fun movie  It was made to appeal to wide range of audiences so the plot wasnt so complex  but prominently featured super powers of Wonder Woman Gal Gadot was absolutely believable as Wonder Woman and there was no other actress of the time who could have played the role asides from her  This show had one really good thing going for it and that was a perfectly cast Gal Gadot in the title role as the immortal Amazon warrior  Princess Diana of Themyscira  Gal Gadot as Diana  Wonder Woman would spin to transform into Wonder Wonder armed with a invincible shield  magic belt giving her tremendous strength bracelets that can stop any bullet a tiara that can be thrown as a returning weapon and a unbreakable magic lasso that can force anyone to tell the truth  Nothing more fun to watch for a boy than to see her running here and there let me tell you It also helps that it usually had a relatively good story line to go along with it  Including an interesting script and story from Allan Heinberg  Zack Snyder  Jason Fuchs  based on the characters created by William Moulton Marston The motion picture was competently directed by Patty JenkinsFollowed by Wonder Woman 1984 2020 in which Princess Diana finds herself trying to stay under the radar working as an archaeologist at the Smithsonian Museum  directed by Patty Jenkins with Gal Gadot  Chris Pine  Kristen Wiig  Pedro Pascal  Robin Wright  Connie Nielsen  And previously ¬®Wonder Woman¬® 2011 by Jeffrey Reiner with Adrianne Palicki as Diana Princess  Wonder Woman  Cary Elwes  Pedro Pascal  Elizabeth Hurley  And the classic series Wonder Woman 1975 with Lynda Carter  Lyle WaggonerHaving read a lot of very negative reviews I expected little from this movie but I was pleasantly surprised It isnt brilliant but I enjoyed it all the way through
The special effects are amazing but I guess we have become complacent and expect them to be good anyway The acting was OK and the storyline kept me interestedSorry but everyone who hated this movie needs to get over all the bulls I usually get bored half way through a marvel film but I was gripped till the last minute  No its not the BEST film in the world but definatly worth a watch and I will be looking forward to seeing the 2nd film in 2019Yes it is yet another super hero movie At the beginning spider man iron man I liked the genre cause it was something different No more spy themes fighting the cold war which is already long over in reality Then it quickly started to bore me and recently I even got annoyed Hulk episode 20 Iron Man episode 30 Spider Man third character
But this had some appeal to me There is some sort of a story There are characters and there is some OK acting The action slowly builds up from some initial Amazon training scenes to later total god mode out of this world in the air hovering boss fight 
If you want a movie to be successful these days you have to do this stuff Either do it or be removed from the theaters after one week After all it is entertainment business
What I really enjoyed is the artwork There is a stunning image language and breath taking beautiful sites And I do value this 
So maybe dont focus so much on the action and enjoy the tastefully arranged sceneryI agree with James Cameron when it comes to this movie This movie did not bring anything new to the comic book world or with female empowerment Wonder Woman ends up being a very bland vanilla character going through almost no character arc from beginning to end The realization that she has at the end of the movie her heros journey presented to us is as basic and hohum as you can getIt has a very basic and predictable plot The fight scenes are very lackluster and few and far between Too much slowmo use with the sparse fight scenes too Also this movie has the worst 3rd act climax ever with bad CGI throughout There was no connection with Ares to Wonder Wonder so you just didnt care for the fight scene at all or whats at stake because Ares just comes out of nowhere as the gotcha villain in the final act There were also no twists in this movie at all so where was all the intrigue I wanted more mythologyWith all that said I still give this movie a 7 which is very generous there are some stuff that I like about it and Ive been waiting for 20 years for this movie This movie is an overrated mess and I think it did so well because everyone just wants to see Wonder Woman on the big screen and they had a great introduction to the character in Batman Vs Superman This is a chick flick superhero movie for sure which is fine but make it more interesting I hope the sequel 1984 will blow this movie out of the waterI found this movie quite entertaining Despite its over two hours duration someone can watch it with pleasure I found many common things to the Captain Americas movie as well as to the God of War action game with a female character instead The movie introduce us to the world of the Amazons A female warrior society where young Diana grows up The photography of beautiful landscapes and world war industrial cities is tied to the movies atmosphere Costumes and vehicles too Dialogs are pretty simply but they are not redundant most of the time Gal Gadots and Chris Pines chemistry is good She is a strong female personality but at the same time she possesses a lot of compassion for the human suffering caused by the war and therefore they have a common ground Acting performances are not great but they are not bad either Everyone has its own separate role and they are all tied up together Choreographies are impressive with tension and quite natural moves for CGI The soundtrack and the sound effects are suitable to the movies theme It is an amusing superhero movie in general which introduces us the wonder woman a member of the upcoming DCs justice league movieGal Gadot is the perfect actress for this role the movie is well paced with a well composed theme song Eventhough they greatly nerfed her character power the movie has thrilling action and the Amazonian goddess is well represented Though I admit it was still a little to groomy and dark for the tone for my taste
Generally a very safe movie if you just want to enjoy somethingI was pretty excited going into see Wonder Woman as the reviews were stellar and the user rating on IMDb was maintaining a high rating after being released several days Alas I dont feel it was that greatLets start with the positives Gal Gadot was great The faults with the film do not lie with her and it was great to see Wonder Woman on screen finally Chris Pine was also great and their chemistry together was sensational The look of the film was also greatNow the not so good The story wasnt entirely compelling WWs journey had some strong points but overall the story felt a bit all over the place There were many supporting characters but they seem to add chaos rather than support It wasnt entirely clear what the point of some of those characters wereThere are some pretty cool action sequences but the CG gets a bit noticeable at timesThere are some other points that bother me but I wont get into those as they may provide spoilersWhen Steve TrevorPine charming wry lands on Themyscira it is the first contact between it and the world of manthe species in a long time and the first experienced at all by DianaGadot bringing to life the idealistic titular character Her smile her grace and her world are all stunning Their chemistry is strong He tells the ethnically diverse group about World War I Might Ares have returned creating the conflict he lives forThere are chunks of this that pass without action Especially in the middle section The climax is less chaotic loud and well blinding than Batman V Supermans albeit not entirely dodging those problems And the first few arent as consequential The initial one is essentially combat training However when its there it is always good and frequently amazing Its not there purely because thats part of why we came to watch Never does it just make people look cool and let the heroine stack up a bodycount Heck she barely kills anyone and she clearly isnt interested in it In one of the too many similarities to Captain America The First Avengera movie it does largely match in overall quality Nevertheless it feels derivative she doesnt like bullies No first and foremost shes doing it to save peopleThis as the leaders of the countries involved are shrugging off massive casualties As No Mans Land is treated as an unfortunate reality not one that is likely to be brought to an end While the two villains who could easily have been combined into one spend their compelling screentime either using horrible poison gas on the defenseless or studying hard to make it even worse Shes there to rescue those shes never met From a race she hadnt even encountered days earlier in her whole life Were in the middle of a comic book movie boom And yet this seemingly obvious value and goal so often goes forgotten these daysOther than the leads a lot of the performers talented as most of them are get lost in the shuffle with only a couple of moments to really shine The Amazons are almost all bad actors ‚Äì I figure they went for physical types instead I would say it could have been handled by hiring talents specifically for when they have dialog and then those would be ones we didnt see in other scenes Mostly they are there to convince you of Paradise Island as somewhere people live work not only fence And they succeed There are pacing issues The ending is bad and borrows from great but mismatched sources Occasionally the message and themes get cheesy and the final resolution is one example Although the humor is rapidfire using the fishoutofwater element well it frequently feels forced and I dont blame those who find it obnoxious and indeed at no point actually funny The DCEUno saying that this is the best of the four isnt saying much has yet to balance jokes with seriousness Its not a perfect film What it is is genuinely engaging and moving Warner Brothers Keep Patty Jenkins around Shell help you properly compete with the MCUThere is a lot of disturbing content in this I recommend it to everyone 710As someone who does enjoy superhero films when done right there are some good ones out there as well as some disappointing ones Enjoyed the character of Wonder Woman as a kid and always felt compared to other superhero characters that she deserved her own filmWhich she gets in this 2017 effort directed by Patty Jenkins Is Wonder Woman as good as the hype and a wonder of a film Not to me there are a few things that stop it from being even better Does it deserve the negativity in a lot of the comments here While it is easy to see why people would be disappointed as it could have been better my answer would be no and that some of the hate is over the topThere are problems here in Wonder Woman Part of it is to do with pacing the film starts a little dull in places and later on as more happens in the story it felt rushed and at times it affects the storytelling which has its muddled momentsThe ending is clich√©d and anticlimactic and some of the characters feel underdeveloped especially the underused and underwritten villainHowever Wonder Woman is mostly an exceptionally made film apart from instances of frenetic editing with a lot of atmosphere in the production design and lighting audacious photography and special effects that are super slick The music has a haunting sense of mood and rousing energy and Jenkins directs with an understanding of the titular character and accommodating the performing of Gal GadotScript has some witty humour heartfelt sentiment and also takes itself seriously without making the mistake of previous BC Extended Universe of which Wonder Woman is by far the best actually being a good film of being too grim and dark The action is stirring and often spectacular in spectacleWonder Womans story has its faults but most of it is heartfelt and thrilling It does the character of Wonder Woman justice with a genuinely interesting backstory that makes her a compellingly real and easytorelateto character who you admire for all her strengths and flawsGadot is superbly cast as Wonder Woman creating a character that really stands out among the rest of the superhero line in terms of gender and her ideals Chris Pine is amusing commanding and likable with great chemistry with Gadot while Danny Houston clearly enjoys himself as the villain The rest of the cast do very solidlyOverall not a wonder but a long way from a blunder 710 Bethany CoxFinally a DC Movie with growing potential Wasnt the best comic book story but definitely star of their movie series Gadot continues to impress and will rival female action stars in years to comeScript action scenes and chemistry can only go up Ranked it only a 7 because story development took too long but audience needed this for future sequels WW stole show in Superman vs Batman and continues to shineBest action movie of the SummerI went in with low expectations therefore I wasnt disappointed However if I were to have lent ear to all the reviews and commentaries I would have been quite annoyed This is NOT a good movie I barely rate it averageThere were good parts in it mainly the feminist aspects of the film Diana is tough but also a woman with a strong personal and cultural desire to help mend love Of course it is taken to ridiculous heights and made completely worthless in the end when she kills a bunch of people but still it was a refreshing if badly implemented point of viewOther than that there is a lot of bad characterization starting with the Amazons and Ares and ending with the three sidekicks that do almost nothing the entire movie Even the villains are underused in a movie that somehow managed to total over two hours There are some scenes that should make the director cower in shame see the they dont know that scene ugh and some bad acting here and thereGal Gadot is beautiful but not an extremely talented actress She did her best though Chris Pine played Captain Kirk complete with motorcycle and the scene where he stops thinks a little then rides another way plus the obligatory self sacrifice scene I think it was some sort of tribute but that part wasnt good in Star Trek eitherBottom line you can watch it just like you would a Batman or Superman movie and expect just as much The savior of DC franchises is no worse or better than the things people called disasters before It is not fun merely time consumingI think the producers are at least 28 years late in finally introducing a female lead as their heroine who would be capable of carrying a huge blockbuster actionadventure film by herself No disrespect to male co star Chris Pine who plays Steve Trevor who himself is trying to save the world from destruction by the Germans but Gal Gadot kicks butt and brings to her audience a believable female action heroine who certainly shows by her actions that she does not need a man by her side to save her in distressI really enjoyed the cinematography as well as the musical score which had great synchronization with the non stop action displayed on the screen The colour throughout the film was dynamic and crisp and I would put my money down that if Gal Gadot had not been just four 4 years old when Michael Keaton was first presented on the big screen as the Batman back in 1989 we would have in fact had a female action heroine winning over Batman at the box office back in 1989Congratulations to the womens movement and to all those preteens who will try and emulate Diana the Wonder Woman as they grow into adulthood The day will come maybe in my lifetime when the next Mixed Martial Arts Champion such as Conor McGregor or boxing champion such as Floyd Mayweather when asked who their idol was growing up and their response is Wonder Woman There will come a time when women will become equal to men in almost every way including as heroes to emulate and boys will emulate strong film characters as Wonder Woman The proof will come when women get paid equal or better than men in Hollywood based on their box office draw and not by their sexI am a proud man and I congratulate Wonder Woman for the strong message it sends to all its audience My only dislike was there was a bit too much CGI Computergenerated imagery during some of the extended action scenes which should have been edited down Sometimes too muchis simply too much CGI I give the film a sound 7 out of 10 ratingIf you are going to see this movie take a cut lunch with you as it is LONG And boring in parts They spent way too much time on the back story and one assumes that was because they are planning sequels The movie could lose 40 minutes without damaging the story line With any of these block buster type Super hero movies I am left with the definite impression many of the reviewers on IMDb are either studio plants or have not seen the actual movie and base their votes on Trailers Much of the final scenes was over bloated and unnecessary and did not add anything to the story Gadot was outstanding in the title role Chris Pine looks as he always does on the verge of tears or a breakdown or something I dont rate him as an actor Supporting cast were good Over all the movie had good production values a so so script and the CGI was good but over done in the final scenes A good movie but not a great movie Worth the admission priceIts incredibly sad to read about how many milestones Wonder Woman touches on especially in this day and age where a highprofile Twitter user must consider every message they post to the world in fear of being racist sexist homophobic or just plain insensitive Despite the influx of superhero movies since Marvel kicked off their Cinematic Universe in 2008 with Iron Man and despite the abundance of longstanding and hugely popular female superheroes existing in the comics and despite audiences calling out for a femaleled superhero film ever since Scarlett Johansson donned the leathers as Black Widow in Iron Man 2 studios have failed to deliver one in 12 years Perhaps the studios were scared they would have another Elektra on their hands but that movie failed because it was terrible and was a spinoff from the alsoterrible DaredevilThe DC Extended Universe in the face of the critical mauling they received last year with the doublewhammy of Batman v Superman and Suicide Squad can only be applauded for taking the muchoverdue risk of launching a femaleled franchise with Wonder Woman a movie that not only represents so much in terms of moving cinema out of a stoneage mentality and into the modern world but surpasses all expectations in a time of superhero overkill Wonder Woman is above all charming funny and exciting and will hopefully help steer the DCEU back on track after an incredibly wobbly start Making her introduction in Batman v Superman and emerging as one of the few positive things to be said about Zack Snyders overblown and poorlyconstructed smack down Wonder Woman begins in the present day but flashes back to the time glimpsed in the blackandwhite photograph sent to her by Ben Afflecks Batman when World War I was in full flow and her heart was won by a spy named SteveThe young Diana grows up on the island of Themyscira a beautiful hidden paradise created by Zeus to be a home for the Amazons a tribe of fierce female warriors tasked with protecting the world from the Greek Gods evil warmongering brother Ares Dianas mother Queen Hippolyta Connie Nielsen attempts to shield her from the horrors of war and forbids her to practice combat while her auntie Anitope Robin Wright realises her potential and trains her in secret Zeus left the islanders a gift a weapon called the Godkiller which will prove decisive when the battle with Ares finally stirs Cue the arrival of Steve Trevor Chris Pine an Allied spy who stumbles on the island while fleeing the Germans He brings death and war with him and the Amazons want to kill him before Diana intervenes revealing he saved her life The tribe want nothing to do with a war waged by man but Diana suspects Ares may be puppetmaster behind the conflict that has taken millions of lives Against her mothers wishes she travels with Steve to London where he reveals to his superiors German plans to release a devastating new mustard gas created by General Ludendroff Danny Huston and Spanish chemist Dr Maru Elena AnayaThe word man carries a special significance and director Patty Jenkins carefully weaves this idea into the film without rubbing it in your face As well as the violent dangerous world of men lurking across the waters there is also No Mans Land the stretch of mud and rubble separating the two warring fronts This is a place that no man can hope to survive and this sets up the triumphant moment seen in the trailers in which Diana deflects machinegun fire with her bracelets and shield before taking out anybody daft enough to stand in her way This scene is made all the more powerful by Gal Gadot who puts in a terrific performance despite her lack of acting experience and puts all the doubters to rest proving to be just as savvy with comedy as the action The fact that we care so much about her also means that the CGIheavy climax which seems to be trend with DC can almost be forgiven Thanks to wellwritten character development and some charming chemistry between Gadot and the ever brilliant Chris Pine there is a real emotional investment that was lacking in DCs previous misfires In terms of origin stories this doesnt rewrite the rulebook but the importance and significance of Wonder Woman should not be underestimatedI watched this movie because of its title Movie is interesting and has some link with movie Batman v Superman Dawn of Justice Ill keep it short not to spoil movie All characters performed good and movie is interesting One may find boring because of Gal Gadot thinking that she can save world from war and retain peaceto start with performance Gal Gadot  Chris Pine really looking nice together Movie starts with proper introduction and with simplicity which is expected Those who think it is feminine movie they are wrong Compared to captain America this movie is one step behind Talk about the story so another world war story with some superhero saving the day which is usual This movie has emotional touch points but without Gal Gadot only god knows can watch with family as bloodshed is normal compared to other war moviesClass from credit to creditCaptures Wonderwoman perfectly with tongue firmly planted in its cheekChris Pine carries the human part along perfectly and it had an Indiana Jones feel about itthose pesky GermansI read all the reviews and have come to the conclusion they are getting better as time goes onshowing us that the earlier watchers had pre concepts of what the movie was aboutso of course they were disappointedJust off the pages of the comic with enough of everything to keep you happyBest part for me was the omitting of any other DC characters and was a true origin movieDo not forget that this is a superhero moviego along and enjoy it for what it isa load of funThis movie has some really incredible potential The thematic relevance and consistency is good the visuals and color grade are refreshing the acting is pretty great and the writing has a lot of good moments and the story is compelling at base Even the action stands above the standard superhero movie in memorability and fun The prop and costume design is absolutely terrificUnfortunately all of this is marred terribly by the editing The entire film is incredibly slow paced for an action movie even several fight scenes feel lethargic There are several scenes present that add nothing to the movie and several jarring oddities The editing needed serious tightening and this issue multiplies existing issues Some of the dialogue is tedious and unnecessary and the slow editing compounds this into making the movie feel as boring as the dialogue at these parts The 2 hour and 20 minute runtime is far too long for the substance of the film There is little outside the editing thats negative with some odd special effects or minor continuity inconsistenciesI praise this movie generally but I cant recommend it for casual viewers Id recommend it only for DC fans or people who dont wish to engage much with the movie
