On the Basis of Sex is a biopic about the early years in Ruth Bader Ginsburgs career As the movie opens she is a first year student at Harvard Law When her husband Martin himself a second year student there becomes gravely ill she attends both her own and Martins classes and of course caring for him A couple of years later Martin is hired by a prominent New York law firm and Ruth transfers to Columbia Law to finish her law degree She graduates top of the class yet not a single law firm in New York offers her a job At this point we are less than 15 min into the movie but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience youll just have to see for yourself how it all plays outCouple of comments this is the latest movie from director Mimi Leder best known for 2000s Pay It Forward Here she brings to the big screen the early years in Ruth Bader Ginsburgs career Let be very clear Ruth Bader Ginsburg is an amazingly sharp lawyer who endured sex discrimination at every opportunity to the point that she decided to do something about AND THEN DID IT Flash forward June 2018 marked the 25th anniversary of her stint on the US Supreme Court In other words this is such a remarkable woman Sadly On the Basis of Sex doesnt do justice to this outstanding woman and lawyer In fact On the Basis of Sex is done strictly bythenumbers without any dramatic tension and with an utter predictability that makes this almost into a snooze fest Some reviewers here apparently do notcannot differentiate between this remarkable woman and what a good movie actually is or should be As it happens in 2018 a documentary about Ruth Bader Ginsburg called RBG was released RBG puts On the Basis of Sex to shame frankly and I am 99 certain that RBG will pick up an Oscar nomination for Best Documentary in the near future and I am equally certain that On the Basis of Sex will not get any Oscar nominations Playing the role of Ruth Bader Ginsburg Felicity Jones bless her heart tries the best she can with the material that she is given but in the end she cannot overcome the movies fatal flaw namely a weak script To be clear Ruth Bader Ginsburg is a shining light and role model for so many and very deservedly so But that doesnt make On the Basis of Sex a good movie Bottom line if you havent seen either of RBG and On the Basis of Sex by all means chose RBG If youve seen RBG already dont bother with On the Basis of SexOn the Basis of Sex has seen a very limited release so far but will expand nationally this coming weekend It currently has been playing in one single theater here in Cincinnati The Tuesday evening screening where I saw this at was attended okay but not great about 1012 people I had good hopes for this movie but when I compare this to RBG there is no doubt which one is by far the better movie Of course I encourage you to check out On the Basis of Sex be it in the theater on VOD or eventually on DVDBluray and draw your own conclusion And dont forget about RBGUPDATE 12219 As I predicted RBG received an Oscar nomination for Best Documentary On the Basis of Sex did not get any Oscar nominations While RBG is a strong contender in the end I see the Oscar for Best Documentary going to Free SoloI was so excited to see the movie but it was a true disappointment She was emotional and angry for the first and half hours The husband and her daughter are stars and need to calm her all the times I think the documentary is much better than this Anyway it is a good story and the camera is good Just not a good movieAlthough I finally watched On the Basis of Sex to honor the recent passing of Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg and although it surely deals with some important legal precedents Im not going to pretend its not a standard even hohum biopic and legal drama It barely rises above an extended episode of Law  Order and even includes Sam Waterston in the cast Generally Hollywood is just bad an rendering anything academic or intellectual on screen and so as here they resort to merely saying over and over again that Ginsburg is smart and to complimenting her writing of briefs They say it because they dont know how to show it When we finally get to the courtroom part they also resort to a trope of a eureka moment where she turns the case around after some fictitious flubbing of it by the Ginsburgswhile of course the level of the musical score is heightened for some manufactured inspirationSuch movies are better at relationship and family dynamics though Indeed the screenplay was written by Ginsburgs nephew When characters arent pigeonholed as sexist baddies or egalitarian heroes the picture does well enough I dont know whether Ginsburgs daughter was as instrumental in her thinking as suggested here but as drama of the real world reflecting the legal battle its effective as is the familys marriage of equals Although their involvement in the case depicted here is reportedly fictional the inclusion of Dorothy Kenyon and Pauli Murray is a nice thought in acknowledging Ginsburgs predecessors Felicity Jones may be miscast but she and the rest of the cast are fine enough I suppose and the focus on Ginsburgs skirts and appearance otherwise in maledominated settings works well As most seem to agree however the documentary RBG 2018 does a better job examining this central figure in the courtroom part of the womens liberation movement and who experienced renewed status as a cultural icon in her later yearsAn average Good Wife episode padded out for 120 minutesThe sets are nice it looks like a70s movie although not enough smokers
But its just so dull And its so annoying the way the movie winks and nods when a male character dismisses a female character
And Jones accent
What the hell Its awful She says a Bostonian sounding word every 20 mins to remind us lawya
Ugh
AvoidFor such an amazing person with such a storied career this movie focuses only on her first case While this is of course important to who she is and would become the plot points herein could have been summed up in about 25 minutes 2 hours later we were left disappointed with what could have been Overall acting passes muster and cinematography never interrupts the snails pace storytelling Its not a broken picture just a very weak one 4 stars and a single tear for the Supreme Court Justice that every American can nameI found this movie more boring than a documentary There was zero chemistry between Marty and Ruth The legal cases were not enough to carry a movie If a man had taken onwon the very same cases that RBG didwould a movie have been made about him DoubtfulPaint by the numbers movie Predicable plot lines and characters with little depth
The film was written by Ginsburgs nephew Daniel StieplemanYes many groups were discriminated in any countrys history Some have advanced to base jobs promotions and people on knowledge skills and abilities some not so muchI dont know how accurate all the events portrayed in this movie are I do know that we as a nation havent really moved forward that much Now I guess its the White Males turn in the box Affirmative Action is Govt sanctioned discrimination against another group Not much has changed Same day different groupThis movie could have been much better There were big names in this but ultimately the writing let the whole story down This was a watered down version It focuses too much on her first case instead of trying to show bits from each of her momentous cases or at least show us a few of her momentous cases where she takes on the law basis of sex I feel like they were trying too hard to give a light to Martin and her kids that they barely had enough room for everything RBG was a better fil about Ruth Bader Ginsburg and it does a much better job of talking about those casesWhen the main character is miscast the movie is in trouble I was drawn to this movie because of Felicity Jones who I thought would be perfect in this role I thought she was great in The Theory of Everything but not here Physically she looks the part but her acting is really bad The writing also really bad Miscasting and terrible writing lead to poor performances It is also important to connectlikeappreciaterespectsomething about a character There was nothing here for meWhat a terrible expression of a prominent persons life work For her to have been portayed so angry reckless and verbally unkempt by Felicity Jones is just too bad And then the drama of her argument where she gets to stand up and put the justices in their place is so typical of the social victim movies being made today where a legal argument gets to be dramatized to project the appearance of some predetermined high level resistence of the justices Its such a poorly represented movie of what really happened and instead of sending the message that there was a problem and it was fixed it instead paints women as victimsFrom the start it is clear what the movie is about but the pressure is too much laying on it and facing too much on itThe music is done below average
Acting is alright but would be much better if there is more reality in itLove how the head of the school is acting
Great how the script is pinpointing how she focus so much on the precise wording and that help the audience to understand how she is manning and able allLove how the partnership is important to keep each other strong and push to the limitedSuddenly in the court she is able to It is clear that the case is put onto a wrong foot especially her speech about sexgenderMany lovely innovative elements and nice stories but in many moments it dips in what is pity they could tell those moments or overall more rapid making the story more action full instead of sinks inDiscard this review because youre a dehumanizing bigot who cant comprehend that a movie can still suck and someone can still support RBGWell made film great actors and role portrayal but so boring I so wanted to like this but nope SorryAt the end of this movie theres a shot of the real character on whose experiences the movie is based  Ruth Bader Ginsberg who is portrayed in the film by Felicity Jones She looks scarily powerful and fascinating In fact in this one glimpse of the real Ruth makes you realise that she has everything this movie hasnt got intelligence and guts Its a very cookiecutter clichestrewn bythe numbers telemoviestyle story of a young woman overcoming gender bias to finally triumph She as portrayed by Felicity Jones who despite valiant attempts at feistiness plays her as a drip Shes married to a drip and theres so much cosy drippiness going on that I found myself constantly groaning Ruth is pretty hubby is handsome and caring all Ruths male antagonists arent pretty etc I shant go on but I shall see the documentary about Ruth Bader GinsbergI dont know how much of this story is factual versus wishful thinking But based on what I know about the history of this Supreme Court justice much of RBGs background was sensationalized and little credit should be given as to the accuracy of this picture This movie seeks to make a political message rather than document the life of a Supreme Court justiceWow this was just a whitewash legacy piece for a woman who is an average justiceSave some time and just pick up a DNC pamphlet instead This movie is another in a line of liberal puff pieces that treat threats against our liberty as a good thing RBG was the first female supreme court justice Good for her After that she is a disgrace The movie shows her fight through her law school and workplace to get recognition It does not show her now falling asleep daily during briefs that she has to judge She is this years winner of Hide and Seek not showing up to court or in the press even for her birthday or landmark cases There is a reason OTHER courts have an age limit why not the Supreme Court Would you want your senile 90 year old granny to weigh in on anything important in your life The film does not stand on its own merits But the left will say you are sexist if you dont worship a judge who does things like demonize a presidential candidate and then demonize a sitting president against the rules of the court Skip this liberal exerciseWhat a martyr Rbg had nothing good to do for our country She was just a piece of dirt in the cog that turns this country Sad movie Hollywood needs to get their facts straight Thats why nobody watches their movies anymore Grow some talent peopleWhy would you make a movie about the second female SCOTUS Associate Justice and not the First May as well make it about the 59th or 281stSandra Day OConner is the woman who actually blazed a trail for women in the field of law and to the highest court in the landBut I suppose no one in Hollywood would want to do an honest film about a Conservative woman who battled her way to the top and was the first woman appointed to the Supreme Court by a Conservative President Ronald ReaganIt would just make it harder to sell the lie that conservatives are misogynistsSo bad its criminal given the subject matter and heroine Oscar bait at its worst Felicity and I should remark Armie Hammer are terribly miscast Somehow the emphasis on her marriage reduced her strength also RBG documentary did her justice Watch that insteadNothing but a political statement of the times Total artistic licenseWell its so inaccurate that you can tell from the start that it is going for statement over biopicAnd it almost seems like it should be titled The Unstoppable RBG as she comes across as right all the time faultless stronger smarter and more capable than anyone to the point where she can argue a case preform brain surgery and create the rocket that got us to the moon in a single night without breaking a sweatShes more perfect here than Mary Poppins and it makes the film sort of unbelievable Ginsburg is human Im sure she had to struggle to over come more than just the evil White Male patriarchy but even that she effortlessly dismantlesHalfway through the movie you expect her to wear a cape and fly away just to prove she can out super Superman as wellIn a Biopic you kind of expect to get to know the character to see their ups and downs Instead however what you get is a golden god with history rewritten to add a healthy polishI really like RBG She was my second favorite justice behind Kennedy but wow This was just so boring and obviously politically biased Everything RBG does is apparently gold also was it just me or was Cathy Bates character very weirdObvious political bias Getting tired of having politics shoved down our throats with main stream news Now thisThe mistake here was making a movie about Chief Justice Ginsburg in the first place This movie never couldve lived up to expectations and the writers too predictably tried to fantasize it Id be insulted if I was GinsburgCopy cat movie anyone who knows history will tell you it was Sandra Day Oconner a conservative leaning Lady who was the FIRST that paved the way for women in the justice departmentnot surprised that
Hollywoodmegaphone of the Democrats  Love this flickThen why did they give her one here This just shows lazy film making and that the director wasnt really into thisThis could have been such a good movie Instead they insisted on infantilizing RGB forcing her into silly gender stereotypes where shes embarrassed in court is visibly distraught and fumbling with her argument RGB is dumbeddown turning a great woman into a silly little Ally McBeal who struggles to win a case when in fact RGB was highly competent and skilled in courtThis movie could have been brilliant if it had focused on capturing the nuances of RGBs life and shown a strong and highly qualified womans way to break new ground instead of portraying it as inexperienced girl fights for feminism The movie fails to portray the actual hard work and the struggle that comes with it and portrays RGB as reliant on Marty to carve out her career when she was in fact brilliant on her own and was both fierce and never lost for an argument Instead they chose to make something easytoswallow with a lead whos not very outstanding not very brilliant and just a fairly bright little girl who had some difficult times who at some point managed to win a case despite all odds which is not really reflective of RGB at allThis movie is an attempt to fit a giant into a sexist stereotype of women because of fear of causing controversyThis is just another in a series of cookie cutter leftist Hollywood social justice films designed as Oscar bait come awards season Even for this genre its a pretty weak effort RBG is portrayed like a mythical figure battling evil white men Its a mythology that supports the new orthodoxy of social justiceInspiring life good trailer such a bad movie Cannot believe how boring it isThe only true thing that the movie got right was that RBG was boring
